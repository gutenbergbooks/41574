<h1>A MAN&#39;S MAN</h1>

<h2><a name="chI" id="chI"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="h3">NAVAL MAN&OElig;UVRES</p>

<p class="indent">A <span class="smcap">University</span> college varies its facial expression
about as frequently as The Sphinx and about
as violently as a treacle-well.</p>

<p class="indent">This remark specially applies between the
hours of breakfast and luncheon. The courts,
with their monastic cloisters and inviolable grassplots,
lie basking in a sunny obliviousness to the
world outside. Their stately exclusiveness is accentuated
rather than diminished by the glimpse
of an occasional flying figure in a cap and gown,
or the spectacle of a middle-aged female of a
discreet and chastened appearance, who glides
respectfully from one archway to another, carrying
a broom and a tin pail, or&mdash;alas for the
goings-on that a cloistered cell may conceal behind
its art-muslin curtains!&mdash;a tankard containing
some gentleman&#39;s morning ale.</p>

<p class="indent">In one corner, close to the Buttery door, you
may behold one of the college cats, which appears
to be combining a searching morning toilet with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
a course of practical calisthenics; and inside the
massive arch of the gateway stands a majestic
figure in a tall hat, whom appreciative Americans
usually mistake for the Master, but who in reality
occupies the far more onerous and responsible
post of Head Porter.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps the greatest variation from the normal
is to be observed on a Saturday morning. Then
the scene is brightened by the vision of an occasional
washerwoman, who totters bravely at one
end of a heavy basket, what time her lord and
master (who has temporarily abandoned his favourite
street-corner and donned Sabbath attire
for this, his weekly contribution to the work of
the world) sulkily supports the other.</p>

<p class="indent">Undergraduates, too, are more in evidence than
on other days. On most mornings they either
stay indoors, to work or sleep, or else go outside
the college altogether. &quot;Loitering&quot; in the courts
is not encouraged by the authorities. Not that
the undergraduate minds that; but it will probably
cost him half-a-crown every time he does so,
not because he loiters but because he smokes.</p>

<p class="indent">The Old Court of St. Benedict&#39;s College&mdash;it is
hardly necessary to say that we are in Cambridge
and not in Oxford: otherwise we should have
said &quot;Quad&quot;&mdash;presents to us on the present
occasion a very fair sample of a Saturday morning
crowd. The observant eye of the Dean, looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
down (like Jezebel) from an upper chamber,
can discern&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">1. Three washerwomen, with the appurtenances
thereof.</p>

<p class="indent">2. One small boy delivering <i>The Granta</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">3. A solitary spectacled gentleman, of the type
described by the University Calendar in stately
periphrasis as &quot;A Native of Asia, not of European
Parentage&quot; (but more tersely classified by the rest
of the community as &quot;a nigger&quot;), hurrying in cap
and gown to secure a good place at the feet of
some out-of-college Gamaliel.</p>

<p class="indent">4. A kitchen-man in white jacket and apron,
bearing upon his head a tray containing a salmon
mayonnaise, cutlets in aspic, and a special Cambridge
dainty known as &quot;Grassy Corner Pudding&quot;&mdash;a
fearsome compound of whipped cream
and pistachio nuts.</p>

<p class="indent">5. A Buttery boy, walking close behind, with a
basket containing bottles. Evidently some young
gentleman is about to entertain angels&mdash;unawares
so far as his bill-paying papa is concerned.</p>

<p class="indent">6. Four young men converging to a group in
the centre of the court. Of these, two are attired
in the undergraduate mode of the moment&mdash;tweed
jackets with leather buttons, waistcoats of
the Urim and Thummim variety, grey flannel
trousers well turned up, clamorous silk socks, and
heavy Highland shooting brogues. The third
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
wears what the College Regulations describe
rather ingenuously as &quot;Athletic Dress.&quot; Pheidippides
himself would have found it difficult to perform
feats of prowess in a costume composed of
split pumps, white duck trousers, and a blazer
admirably qualified to serve as a model of the
Solar Spectrum.</p>

<p class="indent">It may be mentioned in passing that, to the
College Regulations, &quot;Athletic Dress&quot; is not in
itself a costume in which it is possible to perform
athletic feats, but one whose colour-scheme clashes
with the <i>sub-fusc</i> standard which obtains in all
college courts until one <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>; such, in fact, as
would tend to distract the eye and sap the diligence
of those who traverse the courts on their
way to lectures. In consequence, he who would
be matutinally athletic must either keep his warpaint
somewhere out of college, or drape himself
like a stage conspirator as he flits from his rooms
to the river or Fenner&#39;s.</p>

<p class="indent">The fourth gentleman of the party was dressed,
if not gorgeously, sufficiently respectably to warrant
the assumption that he was not a member
of the University.</p>

<p class="indent">All four were smoking.</p>

<p class="indent">The Dean, glancing in the direction of the gateway,
and observing with sardonic satisfaction that
the watchful Cerberus there was taking a note of
the delinquency, returned to his work. Regardless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
of the prospective loss of half-a-crown apiece,
the undergraduates exchanged cheerful greetings.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo, Dishy-Washy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo, Gussie!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo, Towzer!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There ensued an awkward pause, while Messrs.
Gussie and Towzer, nervously conscious of the
presence of a stranger to whom they were about
to be presented, looked intently at their boots
and waited for the introduction to take place.</p>

<p class="indent">The gentleman previously addressed as Dishy-Washy,
a diminutive youth with wizened features,&mdash;his
name was Dishart-Watson,&mdash;cleared his
throat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Introduce my brother,&quot; he said huskily. &quot;Mr.
Poltimore&mdash;Mr. Angus!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The gentlemen indicated shook hands with the
visitor, and Mr. Angus, after a mental effort,
inquired:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come to see us go Head?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He giggled deprecatingly, to show that he did
not really mean this.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hope so,&quot; said Dishy-Washy&#39;s brother politely.
&quot;I hear you&#39;ve got a pretty hot crew,&quot; he
added.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;First chop,&quot; said Mr. Poltimore. &quot;You just
arrived?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; down from town this morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! live there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
&quot;Er &mdash; yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oxford man,&quot; interpolated Dishy-Washy
swiftly. &quot;Sent down,&quot; he added in extenuation.</p>

<p class="indent">The other two nodded sympathetically, and the
conversation proceeded more briskly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Are</i> you going to catch those chaps to-night,
Dishy?&quot; inquired Mr. Angus earnestly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t know,&quot; replied Dishy-Washy, who as
coxswain of the St. Benedict&#39;s boat enjoyed a
position of authority and esteem in inverse ratio
to his inches. &quot;Duncombe&#39;s a good enough little
oar, but you can&#39;t expect a man who weighs nine
stone ten to stroke the boat and pull it along
too. Of course, if we had anything we could call
a Six! As for old Puffin&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fourteen stone of tripe!&quot; interpolated Mr.
Angus, the gentleman in Athletic Dress. &quot;Lord
help the boat!&quot; he added bitterly.</p>

<p class="indent">It may be mentioned in passing that Mr. Angus&#39;s
athletic achievements were rather overstated
by his costume. His blazer was that of a
college club of twelve members, admission to
which was strictly limited to gentlemen who could
absorb a gallon of beer at a draught, and whose
first rule stated that any member who committed
the <i>bêtise</i> of taking a degree, however humble,
should pay to the club a fine of five pounds.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Still,&quot; said Towzer hopefully, &quot;there&#39;s always
Marrable.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
Everybody&mdash;even the gentleman who had
been sent down from Oxford&mdash;cheered up at
this reflection.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By gum!&quot; said the coxswain with sudden enthusiasm,
&quot;he&#39;s a wonder! You should have seen
him in the boat yesterday. He was rowing a
blade that simply lifted the whole of bow side
along by itself; and besides that he was coaching
Stroke all the time&mdash;telling him when to swing
out and when to quicken, and bucking him up
generally; and on the top of all that he found
time every now and then to turn round and curse
old Six. I tell you, he&#39;s a wonder. Did you hear
about him last night?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did hear some yarn,&quot; said Angus. &quot;Went
and smashed up The Owls, didn&#39;t he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Smashed up?&quot; Dishy&#39;s saturnine features
expanded into a smile that was almost benevolent.
&quot;My lad, <i>have</i> you seen Muggeridge&#39;s alabaster
brow this morning?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Muggeridge was the president of &quot;The
Owls&quot; Wine Club.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, last night I was going round about half-past
ten to see that all the crew were in their
beds. When I came to H, New Court, I found
a devil of a row going on in Muggeridge&#39;s rooms&mdash;directly
under Duncombe&#39;s, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Go on,&quot; said all, much interested.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
&quot;There was a meeting of The Owls on,&quot; continued
Dishy, &quot;and they&#39;d had the nerve to hold
it on a staircase where there were actually two
men of the crew&mdash;Duncombe and Eversley&mdash;trying
to get to sleep.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did you do?&quot; inquired Poltimore.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Went in and reminded them. I thought they
might have forgotten.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did they say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They told me to go to&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good Lord!&quot; said the audience, genuinely
horrified at the employment of such language by
a non-athletic to an athletic man.</p>

<p class="indent">The Owls were a collection of rather dissipated
young nobodies, while Dishy wore a Leander tie,
which in a rowing college entitles a man to something
like reverence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I soon found it was a put-up job,&quot; continued
the coxswain. &quot;They had some grudge against
Duncombe, and wanted to score him off. I could
hear him hammering on his bedroom floor above
to make them dry up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did you do then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I explained to them exactly what I thought of
them,&quot; replied the coxswain simply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did you say, exactly?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dishy told them. They smacked their lips appreciatively,
and the next question followed pat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what did <i>they</i> do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
&quot;Well, they were a bit far gone&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Drunken sweeps!&quot; remarked the virtuous
Gussie, who belonged to a rival institution.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. They were a bit far gone,&quot; repeated the
coxswain, with the air of one endeavouring to
explain an otherwise unaccountable circumstance,
&quot;and they&mdash;well, they hove me out, in fact.
There were nine of them,&quot; he added, in the manner
of one who is not quite sure if his excuse will
be accepted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I went straight off to old Hughie&#39;s
rooms&quot;&mdash;there was a respectful intaking of
breath by the company: most of the College were
wont to refer to the gentleman in question as
Marrable&mdash;&quot;and knocked him up. He had just
gone to bed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did he do?&quot; came the question, in lively
anticipation of the recital to come.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Put on a few things over his pyjamas, and
came along with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The audience sighed ecstatically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What happened?&quot; said Poltimore.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, things were getting a bit lively by the
time we arrived. Just as we got to the foot of the
stair we were greeted by Muggeridge&#39;s oak, which
some playful fellow had taken off its hinges and
thrown over the banisters. However, we dodged
that and raced up to the first floor.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
&quot;You could have heard a pin drop when we
walked into the room. One or two of them looked
a bit green, though, when they saw what a towering
passion Hughie was in. Still, Muggeridge was
sober enough, and tried to talk it off. He stood
up, and said, &#39;Hallo, Marrable! This is splendid!
You are just in time to drink to the success of the
crew to-morrow. We&#39;re all sportsmen here. Come
on, you chaps&mdash;no heeltaps!&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He stood waving his glass, but anybody could
see that he was in a putrid funk.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hughie shut the door behind him and leaned
against it, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Muggeridge, I don&#39;t know you very intimately,
but I know this, that you always were a
worm and a bounder. You can&#39;t altogether help
that, and personally I don&#39;t particularly mind,
although you give the College away a bit. Still, I
think the College can bear that. You are quite at
liberty to get full and amuse yourself in any way
you please, so long as you and your pals don&#39;t interfere
with other people. But when it comes to
disturbing my crew, who have to fight the battles
of the College on behalf of warriors like you and
these gentlemen here, whose favourite field-sport
is probably billiards&mdash;well, that&#39;s just what I
call a bit <i>too</i> thick!&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All this time Muggeridge was looking pretty
averagely uncomfortable. The other chaps were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
gazing at him, evidently waiting for a lead. But
you could see he was pretty well up a stump as to
what to do next. However, next time old Hughie
paused for breath, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Oh, get out!&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was a rotten thing to say. Hughie smiled
at him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;All right,&#39; he said, &#39;but I must put you to bed
before I go.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Before anybody could do anything he was
across the room and had a grip of Muggeridge by
the back of the neck and one wrist, which he
twisted round behind somehow. Then he turned
him round, and kicked him all the way across the
room into his bedroom. He used Muggeridge&#39;s
head as a sort of battering-ram to open the door
with. Oh, it was the most gorgeous spectacle!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a little sigh of rapture all round the
group.</p>

<p class="indent">Muggeridge was a prominent member of that
class of society which undergraduates and other
healthy and outspoken Philistines designate
simply and comprehensively as &quot;Tishbites&quot; or
&quot;Tishes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He shut him in and locked the door,&quot; continued
the coxswain, &quot;and then he turned on the
other eight. They were a pretty average lot of
worms&mdash;you know them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a murmur of assent, and Mr. Poltimore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
with rather belated presence of mind, hurriedly
explained to the Oxford gentleman that the
band of heroes under discussion were not in any
sense representative of the rank and file of the
College.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&mdash;And they just sat round the table looking
perfectly paralytic. (As a matter of fact most of
them were.) Hughie laid hold of the biggest of
them&mdash;Skeffington&mdash;and said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;This meeting is adjourned, gentlemen. Just
to show you that I&#39;m speaking the truth, I&#39;ll
heave the senior member present downstairs!&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did he?&quot; asked everybody.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. He&#39;d have killed him if he had. He
picked Skeff up by the collar and the seat of his
bags and said to me, &#39;Watch &#39;em, Dishy!&#39; Then
he carried Skeff downstairs, and slugged him into
the middle of the grass plot outside.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good egg!&quot; murmured Mr. Angus.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Didn&#39;t the others try to bolt?&quot; inquired
Towzer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The idea <i>was</i> mooted,&quot; replied the coxswain
loftily, &quot;but I told them to sit still or they&#39;d get
their silly heads knocked together.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did he cart them all downstairs?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; it would have been too tame a job with
such a set of mangy squirts. He simply came
back and said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Now, you miserable little snipes, I give you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
fifteen seconds to quit these premises. The last
man out will be personally assisted downstairs by
me. I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ve only got slippers on.&#39; Still,
he landed the Honourable Hopton-Hattersley a
very healthy root for all that,&quot; concluded Dishy,
with a seraphic smile. &quot;After that the porter
arrived with the Dean&#39;s compliments, and it was
past the hour for music, gentlemen; but Hughie
slapped him on the back and told him that he
had arrived too late for the fair. Then he went
home to bed as cool as a cucumber. Oh, he&#39;s&mdash;Hallo,
there he is! I must catch him. So long,
you men! See you at lunch, Reggie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And Mr. Dishart-Watson, swelling with importance,
hurried off to overtake a figure which
had swung out of a distant staircase in the southwest
corner of the court and was striding towards
the gateway.</p>

<p class="indent">There was no undergraduate slouchiness discernible
either in the dress or in the appearance of
the Captain of the St. Benedict&#39;s boat. He was a
strong-limbed, clean-run young man of about
twenty-one; perhaps a trifle too muscular to be
a quick mover, but, with his broad back and
sinewy loins, an ideally built rowing-man. He
was a youth of rather grave countenance, with
shrewd blue eyes which had a habit of disappearing
into his head when he laughed, and a
mouth in which, during these same periods of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
exhilaration, his friends confidently asserted that
you could post a letter. He was a born leader
of men, and, as the discerning reader will have
gathered from Mr. Dishart-Watson&#39;s narrative,
was still strongly imbued with what may be
called public-school principles of justice. He entirely
refused to suffer fools gladly or even resignedly,
but had a kindly nod for timorous
freshmen, a friendly salute for those Dons who
regarded undergraduates as an integral part of
the scheme of college life and not merely as a
necessary evil, and a courtly good-day for fluttered
and appreciative bedmakers. He never forgot
the faces or names of any of those over him or
under him&mdash;Dons and college servants, that is;
and further, in his own walk of life (a society in
which you may recognise the existence of no man,
even though he daily passes you the salt or
gathers you under his arm in the familiarity of a
Rugby scrummage, until you have been formally
introduced to him), he never pretended to do so.</p>

<p class="indent">While Mr. Dishy-Washy&#39;s short legs are endeavouring
to bring him alongside the striding
Olympian in front, it will perhaps be well to explain
why it was so absolutely essential to the
welfare of St. Benedict&#39;s College that eight young
men should enjoy a night&#39;s rest untrammelled
by revels on the floors below.</p>

<p class="indent">For the benefit of those who have never made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
a study of that refinement of torture known as
a &quot;bumping&quot; race, it may be mentioned that at
Oxford and Cambridge the various College crews,
owing to the narrowness of their rivers, race not
abreast but in a long string, each boat being
separated from its pursuer and pursued by an
equal space. Every crew which succeeds in rowing
over the course without being caught (or
&quot;bumped&quot;) by the boat behind it is said to have
&quot;kept its place,&quot; and starts in the same position
for the next day&#39;s racing. But if it contrives to
touch the boat in front, it is said to have made
a &quot;bump,&quot; and both bumper and bumped get
under the bank with all speed and allow the rest
of the procession to race past. Next day bumper
and bumped change places, and the victors of the
day before endeavour to repeat their performance
at the expense of the next boat in front of them.
The crew at &quot;the head of the river&quot; have, of
course, nothing to catch, and can accordingly
devote their attention to keeping away from
Number Two, which is usually in close attendance
owing to the pressing attention of Number Three.
And so on.</p>

<p class="indent">The racing takes place during four successive
evenings in the May Week, so called for the
somewhat inadequate reason that it occurs in
June. It was now Saturday, the last day of the
races, and the men of St. Benedict&#39;s knew that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
an enormous effort must be made that evening.
So far they had made two bumps, comparatively
easily. Starting from fourth place they were now
second on the river, and only the All Saints boat
stood between them and the haven where they
would be. They had tried last night to bring their
foe down, but had failed; they were going to try
again to-night, but All Saints were a terribly strong
crew. They had been Head for five years, and
there were four Blues in the boat. Public opinion
admitted that St. Benedict&#39;s were about the fastest
crew on the river that year, but considered
that a seasoned lot like All Saints could keep
on spurting away long enough to last out the
course.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Unless, of course,&quot; people said, &quot;unless
Marrable does something extra special.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was wonderful what a lot the world in general
seemed to expect of Marrable. Character
counts for something even among the very young;
and there is no more youthful member of society
than the undergraduate. The sixth-form boy is a
Nestor compared with him.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile our diminutive friend Dishy, the
coxswain, had succeeded in overtaking his captain,
just as that great man stepped into a hansom
in Trinity Street.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where are you off to, Hughie?&quot; he panted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Station.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
&quot;People?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I&#39;m coming with you. I&#39;ll cut away
before you meet her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dishy was one of the few who dared to address
Marrable in this strain.</p>

<p class="indent">The two installed themselves in the hansom,
and while the experienced animal between the
shafts proceeded down Trinity Street, butting
its way through sauntering pedestrians, pushing
past country-parsonical governess carts, taking
dogs in its stride, and shrinking apprehensively
from motor-bicycles ridden by hatless youths in
bedroom slippers, they discussed affairs of state.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s only one way to do it, Dishy,&quot; said
Marrable. &quot;I&#39;m going stroke.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dishy nodded approvingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s the only thing to do,&quot; he said. &quot;But who
is going to row seven&mdash;Stroke?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bow-side will go to pieces,&quot; said Dishy with
conviction.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps. But as things are at present stroke
side will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s true,&quot; admitted the coxswain. &quot;Let&#39;s
see now: there&#39;ll be you stroke, Duncombe seven,
Puffin six&mdash;it&#39;s worth trying anyhow. We&#39;re
bound to keep away from the James&#39; people, so
we might as well have a shot.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
&quot;Clear out now,&quot; said Marrable, &quot;and go
round and tell the men to be at the boathouse by
four, and we&#39;ll have a ten minutes&#39; outing in the
new order. Then, when you&#39;ve done that, cut
down to the boathouse and tell Jerry to alter my
stretcher and Duncombe&#39;s.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">These commands involved a full hour&#39;s excessive
activity in a hot sun on the part of Mr. Dishart-Watson;
but Marrable was not the man to
spare himself or his subordinates when occasion
demanded.</p>

<p class="indent">The coxswain descended to the step of the
hansom and clung to the splash-board as he received
his last instructions.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And tell Jerry,&quot; added Marrable, &quot;to get
down a new stroke-side oar, with a good six-inch
blade. Duncombe&#39;s has been shaved down to a
tooth-pick.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dishy nodded cheerfully and dropped off into
the traffic.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The old man means business. We shall go
Head now,&quot; he murmured to himself with simple
confidence. &quot;All right, sir, my fault entirely.
Don&#39;t apologise!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And leaving an inverted motor-cyclist, who had
run into him from behind, to congest the traffic
and endure laceration from his own still faithfully
revolving pedals, the coxswain of the St.
Benedict&#39;s boat proceeded at a brisk pace back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
to his College, there to inform a sorely tried troupe
of seven that, owing to an eleventh-hour change
in the cast, a full-dress rehearsal of their evening&#39;s
performance had been called for four o&#39;clock
sharp.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chII" id="chII"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="h3">INTRODUCES THE HEROINE OF THIS NARRATIVE</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> has been said by those who ought to know
that, if the most painful quarter of an hour in a
man&#39;s life comes when he is screwing himself up
to proposing-point, the corresponding period in
a woman&#39;s is that immediately preceding her
first dinner-party in her own house.</p>

<p class="indent">Granting the unpleasantness of both these
chastening but necessary experiences, a mere
male may be excused for inquiring why the second
should be ear-marked as the exclusive prerogative
of the opposite sex. There is no more morbidly
apprehensive creature under the sun than
the undergraduate about to give a state luncheon-party
which is to be graced by the presence of his
beloved.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie Marrable sat back in his hansom with
knitted brow, and checked some hieroglyphics
on the back of an envelope.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let&#39;s see,&quot; he murmured to himself, &quot;<i>Dressed
crab</i>. Can&#39;t go wrong there. Told the cook to
be sure to send it up in the silver scallops with
the College crest on. After all, it&#39;s the trimmings
that really appeal to a woman. Not the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
food, but the way you serve it up. Rum creatures!&quot;
he added parenthetically. &quot;<i>Prawns in
aspic</i>. That always looks nice, anyway, though
not very filling at the price. I remember last
year Kitty Devenish said it looked simply&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie checked his soliloquy rather suddenly,
and, if any one else had been present in the hansom,
would probably have blushed a little. Miss
Kitty Devenish was what cycle-dealers term &quot;a
last year&#39;s model,&quot; and at the present moment
Hughie was driving to meet some one else. He
continued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Cutlets à la reform</i>. Quite the best thing the
kitchens turn out, but not so showy as they
might be. Still, with old Huish&#39;s Crown Derby
plates&mdash;it was decent of the old man to lend
them; I hope to goodness Mrs. Gunn won&#39;t do
anything rash with them&mdash;they ought to do.
<i>Grassy corner pudding</i>. That always creates excitement,
though it tastes rotten. <i>Fruit salad</i>;
<i>crême brûlé</i>. That&#39;s safe enough. <i>Macaroni au
gratin</i>. She won&#39;t touch it, but it&#39;ll please Uncle
Jimmy and Jack Ames. Wish I could have some
myself! Never mind; only about six hours more!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie smacked his lips. It is hard to sit
among the flesh-pots and not partake thereof.
His fare at this feast would be cold beef and dry
toast.</p>

<p class="indent">He turned over the envelope.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
&quot;H&#39;m&mdash;drink. Don&#39;t suppose she&#39;ll have anything,
but I can&#39;t take that for granted. There&#39;s
a bottle of Berncastler Doctor and some Beaune.
I wonder if it would be best to have them open
before I ask her what she&#39;ll drink, or ask her
what she&#39;ll drink before I open them. I&#39;ll have
&#39;em open, I think. She might refuse if she saw
the corks weren&#39;t drawn. Anyhow Mrs. Ames
will probably take some. But, great Scott! I
must ask Mrs. Ames first, mustn&#39;t I? That&#39;s
settled anyway. She&#39;ll probably take whatever
Mrs. Ames takes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then there are the table decorations. I wish
to goodness I could remember whether it <i>was</i>
wall-flower she said. I think it must have been,
because I remember making some putrid joke to
her once about like attracting unlike. Anyhow,
it&#39;s too late to change it now. I&#39;ve plumped for
wall-flower, and the room simply stinks of it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then the seats. Me at the head, with Mrs.
Ames on one hand and her on the other. Uncle
Jimmy at the end, with Ames on his left and
Dicky Lunn between Mrs. Ames and Uncle
Jimmy. Yes, Ames <i>must</i> sit there. Lord knows,
Dicky Lunn should be safe enough, but you never
know what sort of man a girl won&#39;t take a fancy
to. And after all, Ames is married,&quot; added the
infatuated youth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then Mrs. Gunn. I think I&#39;ve told her everything.&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
He feverishly ticked off his admonitions
on his fingers. &quot;Let me see,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>One</i>: not to put used plates on the floor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Two</i>: not to join in the conversation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Three</i>: not to let that wobbly affair in her
bonnet dip into the food.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Four</i>: not to breathe on things or polish them
with her apron, except out of sight.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Five</i>: not to attempt on any account to hand
round the drink.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Six</i>: to go away directly after lunch and not
trot in and out of the gyp-room munching remains.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The tea-hamper should be all right. Trust
the kitchens for that! I must remember to stick
in a box of chocolates, though. And I don&#39;t think
I need bother about dinner, as they are going to
send in Richards to wait. Anyhow, I shall have
the boat off my chest by that time. That will be
something, especially <i>if</i>&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie lapsed into silence, and for a moment
a vision of love requited gave place in his imagination
to the spectacle of the Benedictine crew going
Head of the river.</p>

<p class="indent">His reflections were interrupted by the arrival
of his equipage at that combined masterpiece
of imposing architecture and convenient arrangement,
Cambridge railway station. The platform
was crowded with young men, most of them in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
&quot;athletic dress,&quot; waiting for the London train.
The brows of all were seamed with care, partaking
in all probability of the domestic and amorous
variety which obsessed poor Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">The train as usual dashed into the station with
a haughty can&#39;t-stop-at-a-hole-like-this expression,
only to clank across some points and grind
itself to an ignominious and asthmatic standstill
at a distant point beside the solitary and interminable
platform which, together with a ticket-office
and a bookstall, prevents Cambridge railway
station from being mistaken for a rather
out-of-date dock-shed.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently Hughie, running rapidly, observed
his guests descending from a carriage.</p>

<p class="indent">First came a pleasant-faced lady of between
thirty and forty, followed by a stout and easy-going
husband. Next, an oldish gentleman with
a white moustache and a choleric blue eye.
And finally&mdash;pretty, fresh, and disturbing&mdash;appeared
the <i>fons et origo</i> of the entire expedition,
on whose account the disposition and incidents of
Hughie&#39;s luncheon-party had been so cunningly
planned and so laboriously rehearsed&mdash;Miss
Mildred Freshwater.</p>

<p class="indent">The party greeted their host characteristically.
His uncle, even as he shook hands, let drop a few
fervent anticipatory remarks on the subject of
lunch; Mr. Ames, who was an old college boat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
captain, coupled his greeting with an anxious
inquiry as to the club&#39;s prospects of success that
evening; Mrs. Ames&#39; eyes plainly said, &quot;Well,
I&#39;ve <i>brought</i> her, my boy; now wire in!&quot; and
Miss Freshwater, when it came to her turn, shook
hands with an unaffected pleasure and <i>camaraderie</i>
which would have suited Hughie better if
there had been discernible upon her face what
Yum-Yum once pithily summed up as &quot;a trace
of diffidence or shyness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Still, Hughie was so enraptured with the vision
before him that he failed to observe a small and
shrinking figure which had coyly emerged from
the train, and was hanging back, as if doubtful
about its reception, behind Mrs. Ames&#39; skirts.
Presently it detached itself and stood before
Hughie in the form of a small girl with coppery
brown hair and wide grey-blue eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Joey!&quot; shouted Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She would come!&quot; explained his uncle, in the
resigned tones of a strong man who knows his
limits.</p>

<p class="indent">The lady indicated advanced to Hughie&#39;s side,
and, taking his hand, rubbed herself ingratiatingly
against him in the inarticulate but eloquent manner
peculiar to dumb animals and young children.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chIII" id="chIII"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="h3">JIMMY MARRABLE</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Luncheon</span> on the whole was a success, though
Mrs. Gunn&#39;s behaviour exceeded anything that
Hughie had feared.</p>

<p class="indent">She began by keeping the ladies adjusting their
hair in Hughie&#39;s bedroom for something like ten
minutes, while she recited to them a detailed and
revolting description of her most recent complaint.
Later, she initiated an impromptu and unseemly
campaign&mdash;beginning with a skirmish of whispers
in the doorway, swelling uproariously to what
sounded like a duet between a cockatoo and a
bloodhound on the landing outside, and dying
away to an irregular fire of personal innuendoes,
which dropped over the banisters one by one,
like the gentle dew of heaven, on to the head of
the retreating foe beneath&mdash;with a kitchen-man
over a thumb-mark on a pudding-plate.</p>

<p class="indent">But fortunately for Hughie the company tacitly
agreed to regard her as a form of comic relief;
and when she kept back the salad-dressing for
the express purpose&mdash;frustrated at the very last
moment&mdash;of pouring it over the sweets; yea,
even when she suddenly plucked a hairpin from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
her head with which to spear a wasp in the grassy
corner pudding, the ladies agreed that she was
&quot;an old pet.&quot; When Mrs. Ames went so far as to
follow her into the gyp-room after lunch and
thank her for her trouble in waiting upon them,
Mrs. Gunn, divided between extreme gratification
and a desire to lose no time, unlimbered her
batteries at once; and Hughie&#39;s tingling ears, as
he handed round the coffee, overheard the portentous
and mysterious fragment: &quot;Well, mum, I
put &#39;im straight to bed, and laid a hot flannel on
his&mdash;,&quot; just as the door of the gyp-room swung
to with a merciful bang.</p>

<p class="indent">It was now after two, and Hughie, in response
to a generally expressed desire, laid before his
guests a detailed programme for the afternoon.
He proposed, first of all, to show them round the
College. After that the party would proceed to
Ditton Paddock in charge of Mr. Richard Lunn&mdash;who,
it will be remembered, had been selected by
Hughie as cavalier on account of his exceptional
qualifications for the post&mdash;in company with a
substantial tea-basket, the contents of which he
hoped would keep them fortified in body and
spirit until the races began with the Second Division,
about five-thirty.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How are you going to get us down to Ditton,
Hughie?&quot; inquired his uncle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, there&#39;s a fly which will hold five of you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
and I thought&quot;&mdash;Hughie cleared his throat&mdash;&quot;I
could take the other one down in a canoe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a brief pause, while the company,
glancing at one another with varying expressions
of solemnity, worked out mental problems in
Permutations and Combinations. Presently the
tactless Ames inquired:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Which one are you going to take in the canoe?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, anybody,&quot; said Hughie, in a voice which
said as plainly as possible: &quot;Silly old ass!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">However, realising that it is no use to continue
skirmishing after your cover has been destroyed,
he directed a gaze of invitation upon Miss Freshwater,
who was sitting beside him on the seat.</p>

<p class="indent">She turned to him before he could speak.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hughie,&quot; she said softly, &quot;take that child.
Just look at her!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie obediently swallowed something, and
turned to the wide-eyed and wistful picture on
the sofa.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you come, Joey?&quot; he inquired.</p>

<p class="indent">The lady addressed signified, by a shudder of
ecstasy, that the answer to the invitation was in
the affirmative.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Meanwhile,&quot; said Mr. Marrable, &quot;I am going
to smoke a cigar before I stir out of this room.
And if you people will spare Hughie for ten minutes,
I&#39;ll keep him here and have a short talk
with him. I must go back to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
The accommodating Mr. Lunn suggested that
this interval should be bridged by a personally
conducted expedition to his rooms downstairs,
where he would have great pleasure in exhibiting
to the company a &quot;rather decent&quot; collection of
door-knockers and bell-handles, the acquisition of
which articles of <i>vertu</i> (he being a youth of strong
wrist and fleet foot) was a special hobby of his.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie was left alone with his uncle&mdash;the
only relation he possessed in the world, and the
man who had been to him both father and mother
for nearly eighteen years.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie had been born in India. His recollections
of his parents were vague in the extreme,
but if he shut both eyes and pressed hard upon
them with his hands he could summon up various
pictures of a beautiful lady, whose arms were
decked with glittering playthings that jingled
musically when she carved the chicken for
Hughie&#39;s nursery dinner. He particularly remembered
these arms, for their owner had a pleasant
habit of coming up to kiss him good-night after
his ayah had put him to bed. On these occasions
they were always bare; and Hughie remembered
quite distinctly how much more comfortable
they were then than next morning at tiffin, when
they were enclosed in sleeves which sometimes
scratched.</p>

<p class="indent">Of his father he remembered less, except that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
he was a very large person who wore gorgeous
raiment of scarlet. Also things on his heels which
clicked. He had a big voice, too, this man, and
he used to amuse himself by training Hughie to
stand stiffly erect whenever he cried, &quot;&#39;Shun!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie also remembered a voyage on a big
ship, where the passengers made much of him,
and a fascinating person in a blue jersey (which
unfortunately scratched) presented him with numerous
string balls, which smelt most gloriously
of tar but always fell into the Indian Ocean or
some other inaccessible place.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he remembered arriving with his parents
at a big bungalow in a compound full of grassplots
and flower-beds, where a person whom he
afterwards learned to call Uncle Jimmy greeted
him gravely and asked him to accept his hospitality
for a time. After that&mdash;quite soon&mdash;he
remembered saying good-bye to his parents, or
rather, his parents saying good-bye to him. The
big man shook him long and solemnly by the
hand, which hurt a good deal but impressed
Hughie deeply, and the beautiful lady&#39;s arms&mdash;with
thick sleeves on, too!&mdash;clung round Hughie&#39;s
neck till he thought he would choke. But he stood
stiffly at &quot;&#39;shun&quot; all the time, because his parents
seemed thoroughly unhappy about something,
and he desired to please them. He had never had
a woman&#39;s arms round his neck since.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
After his parents had gone, he settled down
happily enough in the big compound, which he
soon learned to call &quot;the garding.&quot; The name
of the bungalow he gathered from most of the
people with whom he came in contact was &quot;The
&#39;All,&quot; though there were some who called it
&quot;Manors,&quot; and Uncle Jimmy, who, too, apparently
possessed more than one name, was invariably
referred to by Hughie&#39;s friends in the village
as &quot;Ole Peppery.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Very shortly after his parents&#39; departure Hughie
overheard a conversation between his uncle and
Mrs. Capper, the lady who managed the household,
which puzzled him a good deal.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Understand, Capper, I won&#39;t have it,&quot; said
his uncle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Think what people will say, sir,&quot; urged Mrs.
Capper respectfully but insistently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t care a&quot;&mdash;Capper coughed discreetly
here&mdash;&quot;what people say. The boy is not going
to be decked out in crape and hearse-plumes to
please you or any other old woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hearse-plumes would not be essential, sir,&quot;
said the literal Capper. &quot;But I think the child
should have a little black suit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The child will run about in his usual rags,&quot;
replied Old Peppery, in a voice of thunder; &quot;and
if I catch you or any one else stuffing him up with
yarns about canker-worms or hell-fire, or any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
trimmings of that description, I tell you straight
that there will be the father and mother of a row.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said Capper meekly. &quot;And I desire,
sir,&quot; she added in the same even tone, &quot;to
give warning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thereupon Uncle Jimmy had stamped his way
downstairs to the hall, and Hughie was left wondering
what the warning could have been which
Mrs. Capper desired to utter. It must have been
a weighty one, for she continued to deliver it at
intervals during the next ten years, long indeed
after Hughie&#39;s growing intelligence had discovered
its meaning. But her utterances received
about as much attention from her employer as
Cassandra&#39;s from hers.</p>

<p class="indent">However, the immediate result of the conversation
recorded above was that Mrs. Capper made
no attempt to deck Hughie in crape or hearse-plumes;
and later on, when he was old enough
to understand the meaning of death, his uncle
told him how his parents had gone to their God
together&mdash;&quot;the happiest fate, old man, that can
fall on husband and wife&quot;&mdash;one stormy night in
the Bay of Biscay, in company with every other
soul on board the troop-ship Helianthus, and that
henceforth Hughie must be prepared to regard
the broken-down old buffer before him as his
father and mother.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie had gravely accepted this arrangement,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
and for more than seventeen years he and his
uncle had treated one another as father and son.</p>

<p class="indent">Jimmy Marrable was a little eccentric,&mdash;but
so are most old bachelors,&mdash;and like a good
many eccentric men he rather prided himself on
his peculiarities. If anything, he rather cultivated
them. One of his most startling characteristics
was a habit of thinking aloud. He would
emerge unexpectedly from a brown study, to
comment to himself with stunning suddenness
and absolute candour on the appearance and
manners of those around him. It was credibly reported
that he had once taken a rather intense and
voluble lady in to dinner, and after regarding
her for some time with a fixity of attention which
had deluded the good soul into the belief that he
was hanging on her lips, had remarked to himself,
with appalling distinctness, during a lull in
the conversation: &quot;Guinea set&mdash;misfit at the
top&mdash;gutta-percha fixings&mdash;wonder they don&#39;t
drop into her soup!&quot; and continued his meal without
any apparent consciousness of having said
anything unusual.</p>

<p class="indent">He was eccentric, too, about other matters.
Once Hughie, returning from school for his holidays,
discovered that there had been an addition
to the family in his absence.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Capper&#39;s very face in the hall told him
that something was wrong. Its owner informed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
Hughie that though one should be prepared to
take life as one found it, and live and let live had
been her motto from infancy, her equilibrium
ever since the thing had happened had lain at
the mercy of the first aggressively disposed feather
that came along, and what people in the
neighbourhood would say she dared not think.</p>

<p class="indent">She ran on. Hughie waited patiently, and presently
unearthed the facts.</p>

<p class="indent">A few weeks ago the master had returned from
a protracted visit to London, bringing with him
two children. He had announced that the pair
were henceforth to be regarded as permanent inmates
of the establishment. Beyond the fact
that one brat was fair and a boy and the other
darkish and a girl, and that Mrs. Capper had
given warning on sight, Hughie could elicit nothing,
and waited composedly for his uncle to
come home from shooting.</p>

<p class="indent">Jimmy Marrable, when he arrived, was not
communicative. He merely stated that the little
devils were the children of an old friend of his,
called Gaymer, who had died suddenly and left
them to be brought up by him as guardian.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And Hughie, my son,&quot; he concluded, &quot;if you
don&#39;t want your head bitten off you will refrain
in this case from indulging in your propensity
for asking why and getting to the bottom of
things. I&#39;m not best pleased at finding them on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
my hands, but here they are and there&#39;s an end
of it. The girl is five&mdash;ten years younger than
you&mdash;and the boy&#39;s eight. She is called Joan,
and his idiotic name is Lancelot Wellesley. I
wonder they didn&#39;t christen him Galahad Napoleon!
Come upstairs and see them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">All this had occurred seven years ago. During
that time Lancelot Wellesley Gaymer had grown
up sufficiently to go to a public school, and consequently
Miss Joan Gaymer had been left very
much in the company of the curious old gentleman
whom she had soon learned to call Unker
Zimmy. Of their relations it will be sufficient at
present to mention that a more curiously assorted
and more thoroughly devoted couple it
would be difficult to find.</p>

<p class="indent">Jimmy Marrable reclined on the window seat
and smoked his cigar. His nephew, enviously
eyeing the blue smoke, sprawled in an arm-chair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hughie,&quot; said the elder man suddenly, &quot;how
old are you? Twenty-one, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And are you going down for good next week?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot; Hughie sighed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Got a degree?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell you on Tuesday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well&mdash;yes, I should think.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What in?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
&quot;Mechanical Stinks&mdash;Engineering. Second
Class, if I&#39;m lucky.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Um. Got any vices?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not specially.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Drink?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not a teetotaller?&quot; said Jimmy Marrable in
some concern.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s good. Ever been drunk?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Badly, I mean. I&#39;m not talking about bump-supper
exhilaration.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My first term.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What for?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To see what it was like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perfectly sound proceeding,&quot; commented
Jimmy Marrable. &quot;What were your impressions
of the experiment?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I haven&#39;t got any,&quot; said Hughie frankly. &quot;I
only woke up next morning in bed with my
boots on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who put you there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Seven other devils.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you have not repeated the experiment?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. There&#39;s no need. I know my capacity
to a glass now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
&quot;Then you know something really worth knowing,&quot;
remarked Jimmy Marrable with sincerity.
&quot;Now, what are you going to do with yourself?
Why not go and see the world a bit? You have
always wanted to. And do it thoroughly while
you are about it. Take five years over it; ten if
you like. You <i>will</i> like, you know. It&#39;s in the
blood. That&#39;s why I think you are wise not to
want to enter the Service. You can always scrape
in somewhere if there <i>is</i> a war, and barrack-life
in time of peace would corrode your very heart
out. It nearly killed your dad at five-and-twenty.
That was why he exchanged and took to the
Frontier, and ended his days in command of a
Goorkha regiment. Life at first hand; that&#39;s
what we Marrables thrive on! I never set foot in
this country myself between the ages of twenty
and thirty-three. I would come with you again
if it wasn&#39;t for Anno Domini&mdash;and the nippers.
But you&#39;ll find a good many old friends of mine
dotted about the world. They&#39;re not all folk I
could give you letters of introduction to&mdash;some
of &#39;em don&#39;t speak English and others can&#39;t read
and write; but they&#39;ll show you the ropes better
than any courier. You take my advice, and go.
England is no place for a young man with money
and no particular profession, until he&#39;s over thirty
and ready to marry. Will you go, Hughie?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie&#39;s expression showed that he was considering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
the point rather reluctantly. His uncle
continued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Money all right, I suppose? You have eight
hundred a-year now you are of age. Got any
debts, eh? I&#39;ll help you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;None to speak of. Thanks all the same.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well; why not go?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should like to go more than anything,&quot; said
Hughie slowly, &quot;but&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know&mdash;that is&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I <i>do</i>,&quot; said Jimmy Marrable with characteristic
frankness. &quot;You are struggling between an
instinct which tells you to do the sensible thing and
an overpowering desire to do a dashed silly one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie grew very red.</p>

<p class="indent">His uncle continued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You want to marry that girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie blazed up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do,&quot; he said, rather defiantly.</p>

<p class="indent">The cigar glowed undisturbedly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You think that life has no greater happiness
to offer you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sure of it,&quot; said Hughie, with an air of
one stating a simple truth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you are twenty-one?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ye&mdash;es,&quot; with less fire.</p>

<p class="indent">Jimmy Marrable smoked reflectively for a few
minutes.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
&quot;I am an old bachelor,&quot; he said at last, &quot;and
old bachelors are supposed to know nothing about
love-affairs. The truth of course is that they
know far more than any one else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie was accustomed to these <i>obiter dicta</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; he asked dutifully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, for the same reason that a broken
swashbuckler knows a deal more about soldiering
than a duly enrolled private of the line. He
has had a more varied experience. The longer a
man remains a bachelor the more he learns about
women; and the more he learns about women the
better able he will be to make his way in the
world. Therefore, if he marries young he reduces
his chances of success in life to a minimum.
The sad part about it all is that, provided he
gets the girl he wants, he doesn&#39;t care. That,
by the way, is the reason why nearly all the most
famous men in history have either been unhappily
married or not married at all. Happiness
has no history. Happily married men are never
ambitious. They don&#39;t go toiling and panting
after&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They have no need to,&quot; said Hughie. &quot;A
man doesn&#39;t go on running after a tram-car after
he has caught it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That begs the question, Hughie. It presumes
that all the available happiness in the world is
contained in one particular tram-car. Besides,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
the tram-cars you mean are intended for men
over thirty. The young ought to walk.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie realised that the conversation was
growing rather too subtle for him, and reverted
to plain cut and thrust.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you think no man should marry before
thirty?&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing of the kind! It depends on the man.
If he is a steady, decent, average sort of fellow,
who regards a ledger as a Bible and an office-stool
as a stepping-stone to the summit of the universe,
and possesses no particular aptitude for
the rough-and-tumble of life, the sooner he marries
and settles down as a contented old pram-pusher
the better for him and the nation. Do
you fancy yourself in that line, Hughie?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No-o-o,&quot; said Hughie reluctantly. &quot;But I
might learn,&quot; he added hopefully. &quot;I&#39;m a pretty
adaptable bloke.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jimmy Marrable threw his cigar-end out of
the window, and sat up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Listen, Hughie,&quot; he said, &quot;and I&#39;ll tell you
what you <i>really</i> are. You are the son of a mother
who climbed out of her bedroom window (and
let herself down a rain-pipe that I wouldn&#39;t have
trusted a monkey on) in order to elope with the
man she loved. Your father was the commander
of as tough a native regiment as I have ever
known. Your grandfather was an explorer. I&#39;ve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
been a bit of a rolling-stone myself. About one
relation of yours in three dies in his bed. You
come of a stock which prefers to go and see
things for itself rather than read about them in
the newspaper, and which has acquired a considerable
knowledge of the art of handling men
in the process. Those are rather rare assets. If
you take a woman in tow at the tender age of
twenty-one, there will be a disaster. Either you
will sit at home and eat your heart out, or you
will go abroad and leave her to eat out hers. Am
I talking sense?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie sighed like a furnace.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, confound you!&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you promise not to rush into matrimony,
then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps she&#39;ll wait for me,&quot; mused Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How old is she?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Twenty-one, like me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;H&#39;m,&quot; remarked Jimmy Marrable drily.
&quot;That means that she is for all practical purposes
ten years your senior. However, perhaps
she will. Pigs might fly. But will you promise
me to think the matter over very carefully before
deciding not to go abroad?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That being the case,&quot; continued his uncle
briskly, &quot;I want to tell you one or two things. If
you do go, I may never see you again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
&quot;I say,&quot; said Hughie in alarm, &quot;there&#39;s nothing
wrong with your health, is there, old man?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bless you, no! But once a Marrable takes to
the wilds Methuselah himself couldn&#39;t reckon
on living long enough to see him again. So I am
going to talk to you while I&#39;ve got you. I am
taking this opportunity of being near town to
see my solicitor and make my will. I am fit
enough, but I am fifty this year; and at that age
a man ought to make some disposition of his property.
I may as well tell you that I have left you
nothing. Annoyed?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not in the least.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I have left nothing to Master Lance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie looked a little surprised at this.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mean to start him on his own legs before
my demise,&quot; explained Jimmy Marrable. &quot;Immediately,
in fact. That is partly what I am going
up to town for. I am investing a sum for him
which ought to bring him in about two hundred
a year for the rest of his life. He&#39;s nearly sixteen
now, and he&#39;ll have to administer his income
himself&mdash;pay his own school-bills and everything.
Just as I made you do. Nothing like accustoming
a boy to handling money when he&#39;s
young. Then he doesn&#39;t go a mucker when he
suddenly comes into a lot of it. I shan&#39;t give him
more, because it would prevent him from working.
Two hundred won&#39;t. A slug would perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
live contentedly enough on it, but Lancelot
Wellesley Gaymer is a pretentious young sweep,
and he&#39;ll work in order to gain the means for
making a splash. The two hundred will keep him
going till he finds his feet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jimmy Marrable paused, and surveyed his
nephew rather irritably.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; he inquired at length, &quot;haven&#39;t you
any contribution to make to this conversation?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can&#39;t say I have had much chance so far,&quot;
replied the disrespectful Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you want to know what I&#39;m going to
do with the rest of my money? That&#39;s a question
that a good many people are worrying themselves
about. Don&#39;t you want to join in the inquisition?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can&#39;t say I do. No business of mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His uncle surveyed him curiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re infernally like your father, Hughie,&quot;
he said. &quot;Well, I&#39;m going to leave it to Joey.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good scheme,&quot; said Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You think so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rather!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s a lot of it,&quot; continued his uncle reflectively.
&quot;Some of it is tied up rather queerly, too.
My executors will have a bit of a job.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He surveyed the impassive Hughie again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you want to know who my executors
are?&quot; he inquired quite angrily.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
&quot;No,&quot; said Hughie, who was deep in other
thoughts at the moment. &quot;Not my business,&quot; he
repeated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hughie,&quot; said Jimmy Marrable, &quot;you are
poor Arthur over again. He was a cursedly irritating
chap at times,&quot; he added explosively.</p>

<p class="indent">A babble of cheerful voices on the staircase
announced the return of the safe-looking Mr.
Lunn and party. They flowed in, entranced with
that gentleman&#39;s door-knockers (the countenances
of which, by the way, were usually compared
by undergraduate critics, not at all unfavourably,
with that of their owner), and declared
themselves quite ready now to be properly impressed
by whatever features of the College
Hughie should be pleased to exhibit to them.</p>

<p class="indent">One tour round a College is very like another;
and we need not therefore follow our friends up
and down winding staircases, or in and out of
chapels and libraries, while they gaze down on
the resting-places of the illustrious dead or gape
up at the ephemeral abodes of the undistinguished
living.</p>

<p class="indent">The expedition was chiefly remarkable (to the
observant eye of Mrs. Ames) for the efforts made
by its conductor to get lost in suitable company&mdash;an
enterprise which was invariably frustrated by
the resolute conduct of that small but determined
hero-worshipper, Miss Joan Gaymer. On one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
occasion, however, Hughie and Miss Freshwater
were left together for a moment. The party had
finished surveying the prospect from the roof of
the College Chapel, and were painfully groping
their way in single file down a spiral staircase.
Only Hughie, Miss Freshwater, and the ubiquitous
Miss Gaymer were left at the top.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You go next, Joey,&quot; said Hughie; &quot;then Miss
Freshwater, then me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The lady addressed plunged obediently into
the gloomy chasm at her feet. She observed with
frank jealousy that the other two did not immediately
follow her, and accordingly waited for
them in the belfry half-way down.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently she heard their footsteps descending;
and Miss Freshwater&#39;s voice said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wanted to tell you about it first of anybody,
Hughie, because you and I have always been such
friends. Nobody else knows yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a silence, broken only by Hughie&#39;s
footsteps, evidently negotiating a difficult turn.
Then Miss Freshwater&#39;s voice continued, a little
wistfully:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aren&#39;t you going to congratulate me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And Hughie&#39;s voice, sounding strangely sepulchral
in the echoing darkness, replied:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rather! I&mdash;I&mdash;hope you&#39;ll be very happy.
Mind that step.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Gaymer wondered what it was all about.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
Hughie found an opportunity before the day
was over of holding another brief conversation
with his uncle, in the course of which he expressed
an opinion on the advantages of immediate and
extensive foreign travel which sent that opponent
of early marriages back to town in a thoroughly
satisfied frame of mind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There ought to be a statue,&quot; said Jimmy
Marrable to his cigar, as he leaned back reflectively
in his railway carriage, &quot;set up in the capital
of every British Colony, representing a female
figure in an attitude of aloofness, and inscribed:
<i>Erected by a grateful Colony to its Principal Emigration
Agent&mdash;The Girl at Home Who Married
Somebody Else</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he sighed to himself&mdash;rather forlornly,
a woman would have said.</p>

<h2><a name="chIV" id="chIV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="h3">AN UNDERSTUDY</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;<i>The indulgence of the audience is asked on behalf of Miss Joan
Gaymer, who, owing to the sudden indisposition of Miss Mildred
Freshwater, has taken up that lady&#39;s part at very short notice.</i>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">A <span class="smcap">couple</span> of hours later Hughie, roaring very
gently for so great a lion, was engaged in paddling
a Canadian canoe down to Ditton Corner.</p>

<p class="indent">The canoe contained one passenger, who, with
feminine indifference to the inflexible laws of
science, was endeavouring to assist its progress
by paddling in the wrong direction. Her small
person, propped by convenient cushions, was
wedged into the bow of the vessel, and her white
frock and attenuated black legs were protected
from the results of her own efforts at navigation
by a spare blazer of Hughie&#39;s. Her hat lay on the
floor of the canoe, half-full of cherries, and her
long hair rippled and glimmered in the afternoon
sun. Miss Joan Gaymer would be a beauty some
day, but for the present all knowledge of that fact
was being tactfully withheld from her. To do her
justice, the prospect would have interested her
but little. Like most small girls of eleven, she
desired nothing so much at present as to resemble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
a small boy as closely as possible. She would
rather have captured one bird&#39;s-nest than twenty
hearts, and appearances she counted as dross
provided she could hold her own in a catherine-wheel
competition.</p>

<p class="indent">They were rather a silent couple. Joan was
filled with that contentment which is beyond
words. She was wearing a new frock; she had
escaped under an escort almost exclusively male&mdash;if
we except the benevolent despotism of Mrs.
Ames&mdash;from home, nurse, and governess, to
attend a series of purely grown-up functions;
and to crown all, she was alone in the canoe, a
light-blue blazer spread over her knees, with one
who represented to her small experience the head
and summit of all that a man should&mdash;nay,
could&mdash;be.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I expect,&quot; she remarked, in a sudden burst of
exultation, as the canoe slid past two gorgeously
arrayed young persons who were seated by the
water&#39;s edge, &quot;that those two are pretty sorry
they&#39;re not in this canoe with us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The ladies referred to arose and walked inland
with some deliberation. Hughie did not answer.
His brow was knitted and his manner somewhat
absent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hughie,&quot; announced Miss Gaymer reproachfully,
&quot;you are looking very cross at me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She had a curiously gruff and hoarse little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
voice, and suffered in addition from inability to
pronounce those elusive consonants <i>r</i> and <i>l</i>. So
she did not say &quot;very cross,&quot; but &quot;ve&#39;y c&#39;oss,&quot;
in a deep bass.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie roused himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sorry, Joey!&quot; he said; &quot;I was thinking.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sec&#39;ets?&quot; inquired Miss Gaymer, all agog
with femininity at once.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh,&quot;&mdash;rather disappointedly. &quot;About your
old boat, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Hughie untruthfully. &quot;Do you
quite understand how we race?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I <i>think</i> so,&quot; said the child. &quot;Your boat is
second, and it wants to bump into the boat in
f&#39;ont&mdash;is that it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, do it just when you pass us, will
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll try,&quot; said Hughie, beginning to brighten
up. &quot;But it may take longer than that. About
the Railway Bridge, I should think.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And after the race will <i>you</i> take me home
again?&quot; inquired the lady anxiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can&#39;t be done, I&#39;m afraid. The race finishes
miles from Ditton, where you will be; and I
shouldn&#39;t be able to get back in time. You had
better drive home with the others.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When shall I see you again, then?&quot; demanded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
Miss Gaymer, who was not of an age to be reticent
about the trend of her virgin affections.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;About seven. You are all coming to dine in
my rooms.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ooh!&quot; exclaimed his companion in a flutter
of excitement. &quot;How long can I sit up?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ask Mrs. Ames,&quot; replied the diplomatic
Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Till <i>ten</i>?&quot; hazarded Joey, with the air of one
initiating a Dutch auction.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t ask <i>me</i>, old lady.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Supposing,&quot; suggested Miss Gaymer craftily,
&quot;that you was to say you wanted me to sit up
and keep you company?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie laughed. &quot;Afraid that wouldn&#39;t work.
I have to go out about nine to a Bump Supper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A College supper, in honour of the men who
have been rowing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I like suppers,&quot; said Miss Gaymer tentatively.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie smiled. &quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;d like this
one, Joey,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why? Don&#39;t they have any sixpences or
thimbles in the t&#39;ifle?&quot; said Miss Gaymer, in
whose infant mind the word supper merely conjured
up a vision of sticky children, wearing paper
caps out of crackers, distending themselves under
adult supervision.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think they <i>have</i> any trifle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
&quot;Perfectly p&#39;eposte&#39;ous!&quot; commented Miss
Gaymer with heat. (I think it has already been
mentioned that she spent a good deal of her time
in the company of Jimmy Marrable.) &quot;Ices?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me see. Yes&mdash;sometimes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; crooned Joey, with a happy little sigh.
&quot;<i>Can&#39;t</i> I come?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Afraid not, madam. Bump Suppers are for
gentlemen only.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should like that,&quot; said madam frankly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And they are rather noisy. You might get
frightened.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not if I was sitting alongside of you,&quot; was
the tender reply.</p>

<p class="indent">Joey&#39;s anxiety for his company renewed
Hughie&#39;s depression of spirits. Admiration and
confidence are very desirable tributes to receive;
but when they come from every quarter save the
right one the desirability of that quarter is only
intensified. Poor human nature! Hughie sighed
again in a manner which caused the entire canoe
to vibrate. Miss Gaymer suddenly turned the
conversation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What was that person talking to you about,
Hughie?&quot; she inquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That person that came with us in the t&#39;ain.
Miss&mdash;&quot; Joey&#39;s mouth twisted itself into a
hopeless tangle.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
&quot;Freshwater?&quot; said Hughie, reddening.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. When you were taking us round the
Co&#39;ege after lunch you and her stayed behind
on the top of the Chapel, while the rest of us were
coming down. When I was waiting for you, I
heard her say: &#39;You&#39;re the first to hear of it,
Hughie.&#39; To hear of what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie looked genuinely disturbed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know whether she wants it known
yet, Joey,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Gaymer assumed an expression before
which she knew that most gentlemen of her acquaintance,
from Uncle Jimmy down to the
coachman at home, were powerless.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hughie dear, you&#39;ll tell <i>me</i>, won&#39;t you?&quot;
she said.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie, making a virtue of necessity, agreed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, promise you won&#39;t tell anybody,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right,&quot; agreed Miss Gaymer, pleasantly
intrigued.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s going to be married,&quot; said Hughie, in
a voice which he endeavoured to make as matter-of-fact
as possible. It was not a very successful
effort. At twenty-one these things hurt quite
as much, if not so lastingly, as in later life.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m ve&#39;y g&#39;ad to hear it,&quot; remarked Miss
Gaymer with composure.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie looked at the small flushed face before
him rather curiously.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
&quot;Why, Joey?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind!&quot; replied Miss Gaymer primly.</p>

<p class="indent">After that the conversation languished, for
they were approaching the race-course, and boats
of every size and rig were thronging round them.
There was the stately family gig, with an academic
and myopic paterfamilias at the helm and
his numerous progeny at the oars, sweeping the
deep of surrounding craft like Van Tromp&#39;s
broom. There was the typical May Week argosy,
consisting of a rowing-man&#39;s mother and sisters,
left in the care of two or three amorous but unnautical
cricketers, what time their relative performed
prodigies of valour in the Second Division.
There was also a particularly noisome
home-made motor-boat,&mdash;known up and down
the river from Grantchester to Ely as &quot;The Stinkpot,&quot;&mdash;about
the size of a coffin, at present occupied
(in the fullest sense of the word) by its
designer, builder, and owner; who, packed securely
into his craft, with his feet in a pile of small
coal, the end of the boiler in the pit of his stomach,
and the engines working at fever heat between
his legs, was combining the duties of stoker, engineer,
helmsman, and finally (with conspicuous
success) director of ramming operations.</p>

<p class="indent">Through these various obstacles Hughie, despite
the assistance of his passenger, directed his
canoe with unerring precision, and finally brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
up with all standing beside the piles at Ditton.
He experienced no difficulty in making arrangements
for the return journey of the canoe, for
a gentleman of his acquaintance begged to be
allowed the privilege of navigating it home,
pleading internal pressure in his own craft as
the reason. Hughie granted the boon with alacrity,
merely wondering in his heart which of the
three languishing damsels planted round his
friend&#39;s tea-urn he had to thank for the deliverance.</p>

<p class="indent">They found the fly in a good position close to
the water, with the rest of the party drinking tea,
and meekly wondering when the heroes who
dotted the landscape in various attitudes of nervousness
would disencumber themselves of their
gorgeous trappings and get to business. Hughie
deposited Joan beside a mountain of buns and
a fountain of tea, and, after expressing a hope
that every one was getting on all right, announced
that the Second Division might be expected to
paddle down at any moment now.</p>

<p class="indent">This statement involved a chorus of questions
regarding the technicalities of rowing, which that
model of utility, Mr. Lunn, had confessed himself
unable to answer, and which had accordingly
been held over till Hughie&#39;s arrival.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie&#39;s rather diffident impersonation of Sir
Oracle, and his intricate explanation of the exact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
difference between bucketing and tubbing (listened
to with respectful interest by surrounding
tea-parties), was suddenly interrupted by a small
but insistent voice, which besought him to turn
the tap off and look pretty for a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a shout of laughter, and Hughie
turned round, to find that one of those privileged
and all too inveterate attendants upon the modern
athlete, a photographer, was (with the assistance
of a megaphone) maintaining a reputation for
humorous offensiveness, at his expense, on the
towpath opposite.</p>

<p class="indent">After this the Second Division paddled down to
the start, arrayed in colours which would have
relegated such competitors as King Solomon and
the lilies of the field to that euphemistic but humiliating
category indicated by the formula
&quot;Highly Commended.&quot; Presently they returned,
unclothed to an alarming and increasing extent,
and rowing forty to the minute. One crew brought
off a &quot;gallery&quot; bump right at Ditton Corner, to
the joy of the galaxy of beauty and fashion thereon
assembled. The bumped crew made the best
of an inglorious situation by running into the
piles and doubling up the nose of the boat, which
suddenly buckled and assumed a sentry-box attitude
over the head of the apoplectic gentleman
who was rowing bow. The good ship herself incontinently
sank, all hands going down with her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
like an octette of Casabiancas. Whereupon applause
for the victors was turned into cries of
compassion for the vanquished. However, as all
concerned shook themselves clear of the wreck
without difficulty and paddled contentedly to the
bank, the panic subsided, and the rest of the
procession raced past without further incident.</p>

<p class="indent">As the last boat, remote, unfriended, melancholy,
slow, accompanied by a coloured gentleman
ringing a dinner-bell and a spectacled don
who trotted alongside chanting, &quot;Well rowed,
Non-Collegiate Students!&quot; creaked dismally past,
Hughie arose and shook himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Our turn now,&quot; he said. &quot;So long, everybody!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good luck, Hughie!&quot; said Mrs. Ames.
&quot;Your health!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She waved her cup and then took a sip of
tea.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a chorus of good wishes from the
party, and one or two neighbouring enthusiasts
raised a cry of &quot;Benedict&#39;s!&quot; which swelled to a
roar as Hughie, flushing red, elbowed his way out
of the paddock and steered a course for a ferry-boat
a hundred yards down the Long Reach.
Popular feeling, which likes a peg upon which to
hang its predilections, was running high in favour
of Hughie and his practically single-handed endeavour
to humble the pride of the All Saints
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
men, with their four Blues and five years&#39; Headship.</p>

<p class="indent">Still, though many a man&#39;s&mdash;especially a
young man&#39;s&mdash;heart would have swelled excusably
enough at such homage, Hughie cared very
little for these things. The notoriety of the sporting
paper and the picture-postcard attracted him
not at all. He was doggedly determined to take
his boat to the Head of the river, not for the glory
the achievement would bring him, but for the
very simple and sufficient reason that he had made
up his mind, four Blues notwithstanding, to leave
it there before he went down. A Cambridge man&#39;s
pride in his College is a very real thing. An Oxford
man will tell you that he is an Oxford man.
A Cambridge man will say: &quot;I was at such-and-such
a College, Cambridge.&quot; Which sentiment
is the nobler need not be decided here, but the
fact remains.</p>

<p class="indent">However, there was a fly in the ointment.
Amid the expressions of goodwill that emanated
from Hughie&#39;s own party one voice had been silent.
The omission was quite unintentional, for
Miss Mildred Freshwater&#39;s head had been buried
in a hamper in search of spoons at the moment of
Hughie&#39;s departure. But to poor Hughie, who for
all his strength was no more reasonable where his
affections were concerned than other and weaker
brethren, the circumstance bereft the ovation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
the one mitigating feature it might otherwise have
possessed for him.</p>

<p class="indent">As he strode along the bank to where the ferry-boat
was waiting, he heard a pattering of feet
behind. A small, hot, and rather grubby hand
was thrust into his, and Miss Gaymer remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m coming as far as that boat with you,
Hughie. Can I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right, Joey,&quot; he replied.</p>

<p class="indent">They had only a few yards farther to go. Miss
Gaymer looked up into her idol&#39;s troubled countenance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s the matter, Hughie!&quot; she inquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Joey, I&#39;ve got the hump.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Gaymer squeezed his arm affectionately.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind, I&#39;ll marry you when I&#39;m grown
up,&quot; she announced rather breathlessly.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie felt a little awed, as a man must always
when he realises that a woman, however old or
young, loves him. He smiled down on the slim
figure beside him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re a good sort, Joey,&quot; he said. &quot;One of
the best!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Gaymer returned contentedly to her tea,
utterly and absolutely rewarded for the effort
involved by the sacrifice of this, her maidenly
reserve.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chV" id="chV"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="h3">THE JOY OF BATTLE</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Hughie</span> stepped out of the ferry-boat on to the
towpath, which was crowded with young men
hastening to the places where the boats were
moored and young women who would have been
much better employed on the opposite bank.</p>

<p class="indent">The punctilious Hughie was looking about for
a friendly hedge or other protection behind which
he might decorously slip off the white flannel
trousers which during the afternoon had been
veiling the extreme brevity of his rowing-shorts,
when he was tapped on the shoulder. He turned
and found himself faced by a stout clean-shaven
man, with eyes that twinkled cheerfully behind
round spectacles. He looked like what he was,
a country parson of the best type, burly, humorous,
and shrewd, with unmistakable traces of
the schoolmaster about him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I beg your pardon, sir,&quot; he said, with a
rather old-fashioned bow, &quot;but are you Mr.
Marrable?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie admitted the fact.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I just want to say that I hope you are
going Head to-night. You are to row stroke
yourself, I hear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite right, quite right! It&#39;s a desperate
thing to change your crew about between races,
but it&#39;s our only chance. You could never have
caught them with the man you had last night.
He&#39;s plucky, but he can&#39;t pick a crew up and take
them with him. Have you been out in the new
order?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. We had a short spin a couple of hours
ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Satisfactory?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, very fair.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s excellent. Now we shall see a race!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The speaker turned and walked beside Hughie
in the direction of the Railway Bridge. Hughie
wondered who he could be.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose you are an old member of the College,
sir,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Haven&#39;t been able to come up for fifteen
years, though.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In the crew, perhaps?&quot; continued Hughie,
observing his companion&#39;s mighty chest&mdash;it had
slipped down a little in fifteen years&mdash;and
shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot;&mdash;rather diffidently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought so. About what year?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The stranger told him.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie grew interested.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must have been in D&#39;Arcy&#39;s crew,&quot; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
said,&mdash;&quot;the great D&#39;Arcy. My father knew him
well. <i>Were</i> you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Er&mdash;yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My word!&quot; Hughie&#39;s eyes blazed at the mention
of the name, which, uttered anywhere along
the waterside between Putney Bridge and Henley,
still rouses young oarsmen to respectful dreams
of distant emulation and middle-aged coaches to
floods of unreliable reminiscence. &quot;He must have
been a wonder in his time. Did you know him
well? What sort of chap was he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well&mdash;you see&mdash;I <i>am</i> D&#39;Arcy,&quot; replied the
stranger apologetically.</p>

<p class="indent">After that he gave Hughie advice about the
coming race.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have watched the All Saints crew for three
nights now,&quot; he said. &quot;They are a fine lot, and
beautifully together; but it is my opinion that
they can&#39;t last.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They&#39;re a bit too sure of themselves,&quot; said
Hughie. &quot;Too many Blues in the boat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How many?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Four. Seven, Six, Five, and Bow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good! They are probably labouring under
the delusion that a boat with four Blues in it is
four times as good as a boat with one Blue in it.
Consequently they haven&#39;t trained very hard,
especially those two fat men in the middle of the
boat. What about their Stroke?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
&quot;Pretty enough, but a rotter when it comes to
the pinch.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good again! Well, these fellows have not
once been extended during the races, for you
gave them no sort of a run last night. You went
to bits at the start and never quite recovered.
However, that will give All Saints some false
confidence, which is just what we want. Now
what do you propose to do to-night? Jump on
to their tails at the start?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No good,&quot; said Hughie. &quot;They are too old
birds for that game. Besides, my crew want very
carefully working up to a fast stroke. I can&#39;t
trust Six at anything above thirty-four. He&#39;ll
go on rowing that all day; but if I quicken up
to thirty-six or seven he gets flustered, and forty
sends him clean off his nut after about a minute.
No, we must just wear them down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite right,&quot; said D&#39;Arcy. &quot;If you are within
a length at the Railway Bridge you ought just
to do it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The difficulty is,&quot; said Hughie ruefully, &quot;that
the crew are only good for about one spurt. It&#39;s
a good spurt, I must say, but if it fails we are
done. They can never slow down to a steady
stroke again&mdash;especially Six. So it simply has
to be made at the right moment. The difficulty
is to know when.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you got a reliable cox?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
&quot;First-class.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can&#39;t he tell you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Too much row going on,&quot; said Hughie. &quot;The
whole College will be on the towpath to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Reverend Montague D&#39;Arcy plunged his
hand into the tail-pocket of his clerical frock-coat,
and produced therefrom a large-pattern service
revolver.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look here,&quot; he said. &quot;You would be able to
hear this lethal weapon on the Day of Judgment
itself. Will you consent to take your time from
me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rather! Thank you, sir.&quot; There was no
doubting the sincerity of Hughie&#39;s gratitude.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; continued the clergyman briskly, &quot;I
shall wait by the Railway Bridge, on the Barnwell
side, away from the towpath. If you have
made your bump before that you won&#39;t want me.
Well and good. But I don&#39;t think you <i>will</i> have
made it, and I don&#39;t advise you to try. For the
first half of the course those All Saints men will
match you stroke for stroke, and if you hustle
your heavy man at Six he will probably lose his
head. As you pass under the Railway Bridge
quicken slightly&mdash;not more than two strokes
a minute, though. I have six shots in this revolver.
When you hear two of them, that will
mean that you are getting within jumping distance
and must be ready for the spurt. When you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
hear the remaining four in quick succession you
must simply swing out and put the very last ounce
of your blood and bones and bodies and souls
into it. And if you catch &#39;em,&quot; concluded the
reverend gentleman, &quot;by gad! I&#39;ll dance the
Cachuca on the bank!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">By this time they had reached the spot where
their racing-shell&mdash;sixty-two feet of flimsy cedar
wood&mdash;was lying waiting for them. The rest of
the crew, already assembled, were standing about
in the attitudes of profound dejection or forced
hilarity which appear to be the only alternatives
of deportment open to men who are suffering
from what is expressively termed &quot;the needle.&quot;
Some were whistling, others were yawning, and
all were wondering why on earth men took up
rowing as a pastime.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie gathered his Argonauts into a knot,
and at his request the Reverend Montague D&#39;Arcy
outlined to them the plan of campaign. Then
the crew embarked, and the stout clergyman
assisted the grizzled College boatman&mdash;the only
person present whose nerves appeared unaffected
by the prevailing tension&mdash;to push their craft
clear of the bank, and set them going on a half-minute
dash as a preliminary to their long paddle
down the course to the starting point of the race.</p>

<p class="indent">In accordance with a picturesque but peculiar
custom they wore in their straw hats bunches of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
marigolds and corn-flowers&mdash;the College colours&mdash;as
an intimation that they had achieved
bumps during the preceding nights; and so bedecked
they paddled majestically down the Long
Reach, feeling extremely valorous and looking
slightly ridiculous, to challenge a comparison (in
which they were hopelessly outclassed from the
start) with the headgear of the assembled fair in
Ditton Paddock.</p>

<p class="indent">The method of sending off a bumping race is
the refinement of cruelty.</p>

<p class="indent">As each boat reaches its starting-post the crews
disembark and stand dismally about, listening to
the last exhortations of coaches or nervously eyeing
the crew behind them. Presently an objectionably
loud piece of artillery, situated half-way
down the long line of boats, goes off with a roar.
This is called &quot;first gun,&quot; and means chiefly that
there will be another in three minutes. The crew
mournfully denude themselves of a few more
articles of their already scanty wardrobe, which
they pile upon the shoulders of the perspiring
menial whose duty it is to convey the same to
the finishing-post, and crawl one by one into
their places in the boat. Finally, the coxswain
coils himself into his seat and takes both rudder-lines
in his left hand, leaving the right free to
grasp the end of the boat&#39;s last link with <i>terra
firma</i>, her starting-chain. Then the second gun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
goes, and the crew shudder and know that in
sixty seconds precisely they must start.</p>

<p class="indent">The ritual observed during the final minute is
complicated in the extreme, and varies directly
with the nervous system of the coach, who dances
upon the bank with a stop-watch in his hand,
to time the ministrations of the College boatman,
who stands by with a long boat-hook ready
to prod the vessel into midstream.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fifteen seconds gone,&quot; says the coach. &quot;Push
her out, Ben.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ben complies, with a maddening but wise deliberation.
If the boat is pushed out too promptly
the starting-chain will grow taut and tug the stern
of the boat inwards towards the bank, just when
her nose should be pointing straight upstream.
But this elementary truth does not occur to the
frenzied octette in the boat. The gun will go, and
bow-side will find their oar-blades still resting on
the towpath. They <i>know</i> it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thirty seconds gone,&quot; says the coach. &quot;Paddle
on gently, Bow and Two.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His object is to get the full advantage of the
length of the chain, but Bow and Two know
better. They are convinced that he merely desires
that they shall be caught at a disadvantage
when the gun fires. However, they paddle on as
requested, with a palsied stealthiness that suggests
musical chairs.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
&quot;Fifteen seconds left,&quot; says the coach. &quot;Are
you straight, Cox? Ten more sec&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ah! As usual the chain has drawn tight, and
the stern of the boat is being dragged inwards
again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Paddle on, Two!&quot; yells the coxswain.</p>

<p class="indent">Two gives a couple of frenzied digs; the Dervish
with the watch, accompanied by a ragged
and inaccurate chorus all down the bank, chants
&quot;Five, four, three, two&mdash;&quot;; there is a terrific
roar from the gun; the coxswain drops the chain;
the boatman slips the point of his boat-hook
(which, between ourselves, has been doing the
lion&#39;s share in keeping the ship&#39;s head straight)
from Five&#39;s rigger; and they are off.</p>

<p class="indent">The Benedictine crew got under way very unostentatiously.
Their coach was actually rowing
in the All Saints boat,&mdash;and it would be difficult
to select a more glowing testimonial to the sterling
sportsmanship of English rowing,&mdash;so the
starting operations were wisely left to the College
boatman, who had performed the office for
something like half a century. The flight of time
was recorded by Hughie himself, from the watch
which hung on his stretcher beside his right foot.
The experienced Mr. Dishart-Watson kept those
too-often fatally intimate acquaintances, the rudder-lines
and starting-chain, tactfully apart, and
the St. Benedict&#39;s boat got off the mark with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
start that brought her within a length of All
Saints during the first half-minute.</p>

<p class="indent">After that their opponents drew away. As
D&#39;Arcy had said, they were a seasoned crew, and
nothing short of sheer superiority would wear
them down. The two boats swung round Grassy
Corner and entered the Plough Reach about their
distance apart. All Saints were rowing the faster
stroke.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie, who was keeping to a steady thirty-two,
felt with satisfaction that the men behind
him were well together. Number Seven, small
but plucky, was setting bow-side a beautiful example
in steady swing and smart finish. Six&mdash;Mr.
Puffin&mdash;was rowing a great blade. To look
at him now, you would ask why he had not been
included in the University Crew. If you saw him
trying to row forty to the minute, you would
marvel that he should be included in any crew
at all.</p>

<p class="indent">Five was not looking happy. He was lying
back too far and tugging at the finish. To him
the boat seemed heavier than usual, for he was
just beginning to realise the difference between
seconding the efforts of Hughie Marrable and
those of Mr. Duncombe. Still, he was plugging
gamely. Four, a painstaking person, was encouraging
himself in a fashion entirely his own.
After every stroke, as he sat up and swung forward,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
he gasped out some little <i>sotto voce</i> remark
to himself, such as, &quot;Oh, well <i>rowed</i>, Four!&mdash;Stick
to it, Four!&mdash;Use your <i>legs</i>, old man!&mdash;That&#39;s
better!&mdash;That&#39;s a <i>beauty</i>!&mdash;Oh, well
<i>rowed</i>, Four!&quot; And so on. Where he got the
necessary breath for these exercises nobody knew;
but some folk possess these little peculiarities,
and row none the worse for them. Bow was another
instance. He was a chirpy but eccentric individual,
and used to sing to himself some little
ditty of the moment&mdash;or possibly a hymn&mdash;all
through a race, beginning with the first stroke
and ending exactly, if possible, with the last.
He had been known, when stroking a boat, to
quicken up to a perfectly incredible rate simply
because he feared that the song would end before
he completed the course, a contingency which he
regarded as unlucky in the extreme. On the
other hand, he would become quite depressed if
he had to stop in the middle of a verse, and he
was quite capable of rowing <i>rallentando</i> if he desired
to synchronise his two conclusions.</p>

<p class="indent">But few people have the time or inclination for
these diversions while oscillating upon a sixteen-inch
slide, and the rest of the crew were swinging
at and plugging in grim silence.</p>

<p class="indent">The two boats swept into the roaring medley
of Ditton Corner. They flashed past the row of
piles and tethered punts amid a hurricane of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
shouts and waving handkerchiefs. Hughie, wrongfully
exercising his privilege as Stroke, allowed his
eyes to slide to the right for a moment. He had
a fleeting glimpse of the crimson and excited
countenance of Miss Gaymer, as some man held
her aloft in the crowd. Then the boat gave a
slight lurch, and Joey was swallowed up again.
Hughie felt guiltily responsible for the lurch,
and recalling his gaze into the proper channel&mdash;straight
over the coxswain&#39;s right shoulder&mdash;swung
out again long and steadily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are we straight yet?&quot; he gasped to Dishy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes&mdash;just.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell &#39;em to reach out a bit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Watson complied, in tones that rose high
above the tumult on the bank and penetrated
even into the harmonious soul of Bow, who was
grappling with a difficult cadenza at the moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Six good ones!&quot; said Hughie, next time his
face swung up towards the coxswain&#39;s.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, you men, six good ones!&quot; echoed Dishy.
&quot;<i>One! Two!</i> Five, you&#39;re late! <i>Three! Four!
Five!</i> Bow, get hold of it! <i>Six!</i> Oh, well rowed!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a delighted roar from the bank.
The Benedictine crew were together again after
the unsteadiness round Ditton.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How far?&quot; signalled Hughie&#39;s lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Length&mdash;and&mdash;a&mdash;half,&quot; replied Cox.
&quot;Less,&quot; he added, peering ahead.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
They were half-way up the Long Reach now.
In another minute or two they would be at the
Railway Bridge, beyond which hard-pressed boats
are popularly supposed to be safe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell &#39;em&mdash;going&mdash;quicken,&quot; gurgled Hughie,
&quot;if can.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Cox nodded, rather doubtfully, and Hughie
ground his teeth. If only this accursed noise on
the bank would cease, even for five seconds,
Dishy would get a chance to make the crew hear.
As it was, the ever-increasing crowd, rolling up
fresh adherents like a snowball, made that feat
almost an impossibility.</p>

<p class="indent">But the coxswain was a man of experience and
resource. Just as the boat passed under the Railway
Bridge itself there was a momentary silence,
for the crew were shut off from their supporters
by some intervening balks of timber. Dishy
seized the opportunity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Be ready to quicken,&quot; he yelled. &quot;Now! Oh,
well done!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The crew had heard him, and what was more,
they had obeyed him. Stroke in the All Saints
boat suddenly realised that the oncoming foe had
quickened to thirty-five or six, and that the interval
between the two boats had shrunk to something
under a length. He spurted in his turn,
and his men spurted with him, but their length
of stroke grew proportionately shorter, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
pace of the boat did not increase. St. Benedict&#39;s
were holding their advantage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Half a length,&quot; said Dishy, in response to
an agonised interrogation from Hughie&#39;s right
eyebrow.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly above the tumult there rang out two
reverberating revolver-shots. A stout clergyman,
whooping like a Choctaw, was tearing along the
right bank of the river, which was practically
clear of spectators, with his weapon smoking in
his hand. Dishy&#39;s voice rose to a scream.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look out&mdash;be ready! <i>Only</i> six feet!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And now the musical gentleman who was
rowing bow felt the boat lift unsteadily under
him. A wave rolled across the canvas decking
behind him, and he felt a splash of water on his
back.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Washing us off!&quot; was his comment. &quot;Glory,
glory! Another verse&#39;ll do it. Now then, all
together,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;<i>What though the spicy breezes</i></span><br />
<span class="i2"><i>Blow soft, o&#39;er Ceylon&#39;s&mdash;</i>&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Bang! bang! bang! bang!</p>

<p class="indent">The great service revolver rang out. The nose
of the Benedictine boat, half submerged in a
boiling flood, suddenly sprang to within three
feet of the All Saints rudder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Now</i>, you men!&quot; Mr. Dishart-Watson&#39;s
wizened and saturnine countenance shrank suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
and alarmingly to a mere rim surrounding
his mouth. &quot;Just <i>ten</i> more! <i>One&mdash;two&mdash;</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Like St. Francis of Assisi, &quot;Of all his body he
made a tongue.&quot; He counted the strokes in tones
that overtopped all the roars of encouragement
and apprehension arising from the now hopelessly
mixed-up mob of Benedictine and All Saints
men that raged alongside. Hughie Marrable
quickened and quickened, and his crew responded
sturdily. Faster and faster grew the stroke, and
more and more pertinaciously did the nose of the
Benedictine boat plough its way through the turbid
waves emitted by the twitching rudder in
front. Never had they travelled like this. Six
was rowing like a man possessed. Four had ceased
to encourage himself, and was plugging automatically
with his chest open and his eyes shut.
Bow may or may not have been singing: he was
certainly rowing. There was a world of rolling
and splashing, for the All Saints coxswain was
manipulating his rudder very skilfully, and ever
and again the aggressive nose of the Benedictine
boat was sent staggering back by a rolling buffeting
wave. But there was no stopping the Benedictines.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly Dishy gave vent to a final cataclysmic
bellow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re overlapping!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They were almost at Charon&#39;s Grind. The coxswain&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
lank body stiffened in its little seat, and
Hughie saw him lean hard over and haul on to
the right-hand rudder-line.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Last three strokes! Now, you devils! <i>Plug!
plug! pl</i>&mdash;Aa&mdash;a&mdash;ee&mdash;ooh&mdash;ee&mdash;easy all!
Oh, well rowed, well rowed, well rowed!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a lurch and a bump.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Done it!&mdash;&#39;<i>Bows down to wood and stone</i>,&#39;&quot;
gasped Bow.</p>

<p class="indent">The eight men let go their oars and tumbled
forward on to their stretchers, and listened, with
their heads and hearts bursting, to the din that
raged on the bank.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a fine confused moment.</p>

<p class="indent">In the boat itself Cox was vainly endeavouring
to shake hands with Stroke, who lay doubled up
over his oar, with his head right down on the
bottom of the boat, oblivious to everything save
the blessed fact that he need not row any more.
Consciousness that he had taken his crew to the
Head of the River was yet to come. At the other
end Bow, with his head clasped between his knees,
was croaking half-hysterically to himself, &quot;Two
bars too soon, Hughie! Oh, my aunt, we&#39;ve gone
Head! Two bars too soon!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On the towpath every one was shouting and
shaking hands with indiscriminate <i>bonhomie</i>,&mdash;this
was one of those occasions upon which even
the ranks of Tuscany could scarce forbear to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
cheer,&mdash;and everybody, with one exception,
seemed to be ringing a bell or blowing a trumpet.
The exception was supplied by a trio of young
gentlemen, two of whom held an enormous
Chinese gong suspended between them, while a
third smote the same unceasingly with a mallet,
and cried aloud the name of Marrable. It must
be recorded here, to his honour, that the smiter
bore upon his forehead an enormous and highly
coloured bruise, suggestive of sudden contact
with, say, a bedroom-door.</p>

<p class="indent">On the opposite bank of the river, a stout,
middle-aged, and apparently demented Clerk in
Holy Orders was dancing the Cachuca.</p>

<p class="h3">KNIGHT-ERRANTRY <i>À LA MODE</i></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">If</span> all good Americans go to Paris when they
die, it may safely be predicted that all the bad
ones will be booked through to Coney Island.</p>

<p class="indent">So much may be inferred from the regularity
and zeal with which the Toughs, Hoboes, Bowery
Boys, and other fearful wildfowl of the New York
proletariat, accompanied by the corresponding
females of the species, betake themselves every
Sabbath by trolley-car or steamer to this haunt
of ancient peace (which, by the way, is not to all
appearances an island and harbours no conies).</p>

<p class="indent">Take Margate and Douglas and Blackpool, and
pile them into an untidy heap; throw in a dozen
Fun-Cities from Olympia and half a score of
World&#39;s Fairs from the Agricultural Hall; add
some of the less reputable features of Earl&#39;s Court
and Neuilly Fair; include a race-course of the
baser sort; case the whole in wood, and people
it with sallow gentlemen in striped jerseys and
ladies answering exclusively to such names as
Hattie, Sadie, and Mamie, reared up apparently
upon an exclusive diet of peanuts and clam-chowder;
keep the whole multitude duly controlled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
and disciplined by a police force which, if
appearances go for anything, has been recruited
entirely from the criminal classes; and you will
be able faintly to realise what Coney Island can
do when it tries on a fine Sunday in summer.</p>

<p class="indent">So thought Hughie Marrable. He had been
wandering round the world for nine years now;
but not even a previous acquaintance with the
Devil Dancers of Ceylon, the unhallowed revels
of Port Said, or the refinements of a Central
African Witch-Hunt (with full tom-tom accompaniment),
had quite prepared him for this.
Still, it was part and parcel of Life, and Life was
what he had left England to see.</p>

<p class="indent">He had arrived in New York from San Francisco
two days ago. But let it not be imagined
that he had been conveyed thither by any
Grand-Trunk-Ocean-to-Ocean-Limited, or other
refinement of an effete modernity. His transcontinental
journey had occupied just three years.
Since the day on which he steamed through the
Golden Gate on a tramp-freighter from Yokohama
he had been working his way eastward by
easy stages, acquiring experience (as Jimmy Marrable
had directed) of the manner in which the
other half of the world lives. Incidentally he had
mixed cocktails behind a Nevada bar; learned to
fire a revolver without taking it out of his pocket;
accompanied a freight train over the Rockies in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
the capacity of assistant brakeman&mdash;his duties
being chiefly confined to standing by with a
coupling-pin, to discourage the enterprise of those
gentlemen of the road who proposed to travel
without tickets; and once, in a Southern State,
he had been privileged to be present at that ennobling
spectacle to which the brightest nation
on earth occasionally treats the representatives
of an older civilisation&mdash;the lynching of a negro.</p>

<p class="indent">In a few days Hughie would sail for England,
on board the mighty Apulia. It was not often
that he travelled in such ostentatious luxury: the
primitive man in him leaned towards something
damp and precarious on board a sailing-ship or a
collier; but he happened to know that the Apulia
intended going for the ocean record this trip; and
since the third engineer happened to be a friend
of his, Hughie had decided that four-and-a-half
days and nights down among the humming turbines
and the spirits that controlled them would
be cheap at the price of an expensively upholstered
state-room many decks above, in which
he would leave his baggage and occasionally sleep.</p>

<p class="indent">For all that he had cast a regretful eye only
that very morning on a battered little tramp-steamer
which was loading up with cargo alongside
a wharf at Hoboken&mdash;due to sail for Europe,
so a stevedore told him, in about two days&#39; time.</p>

<p class="indent">To-morrow he was to be taken yachting in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
New York harbour by an old P. and O. acquaintance,
whom he had faithfully &quot;looked up,&quot; in
accordance with a two-year-old promise, at his
city office that morning. In the evening, at the
invitation of an American actor to whom he had
once been of service in Calcutta, he was to dine
at the Lambs&#39; Club,&mdash;the New York equivalent
of the Garrick and Green Room, with a dash of
the Eccentric thrown in,&mdash;and the next day he
was to pay a flying visit to Atlantic City.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile he was putting in a few off-hours
at Coney Island. He had watched the islanders
bathing, had witnessed a display of highly&mdash;not
to say epileptically&mdash;Animated Pictures, had
spent half-an-hour in an open <i>café-chantant</i>, where
a bevy of tired-looking girls in short skirts pranced
about with mechanical abandon at the back of the
small stage, shouting the chorus of a ditty which
a wheezy lady (who looked like the mother of all
chorus-girls) was singing at the front; and had
declined a pressing invitation from the keeper of
an Anatomical Museum to step inside and &quot;have
a dollar&#39;s worth for a dime.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Finally he drifted into a small theatre, where a
melodrama of distinctly British flavour (seasoned
to the Coney Island palate by a few distinctly
local interpolations) was unfolding itself to a
closely packed and hard-breathing audience.</p>

<p class="indent">To judge from the state of the atmosphere the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
entertainment had been in progress for some time.
As Hughie took his seat the curtain rose on a
moonlit military scene. Figures wrapped in great-coats
sat round a camp-fire on the audience&#39;s
right hand, the only plainly recognisable character
being the Heroine, who, attired as a hospital nurse
and positively starred with red crosses, was sewing
aloofly upon an erection which looked like a
sarcophagus, but was marked in plain figures
&quot;Ambulence.&quot; A sentry, who from his gait
Hughie took (rightly) to be the Comic Man, was
pacing up and down at the back.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently the guard was changed, with much
saluting of a pattern unknown at any War Office,
and the Comic Man, released from duty, was
called upon to sing &quot;that dear ole song you useter
sing at &#39;ome.&quot; The cold light of the moon having
been temporarily replaced by broad daylight in
order to give the singer&#39;s facial expression full
play, he obliged; though why any one who had
heard him sing the song before should have
asked him to sing it again passed Hughie&#39;s comprehension.
Next a drummer-boy (female) was
called upon by the company, and after a great
exhibition of reluctance,&mdash;fully justified by her
subsequent performance,&mdash;gave vent to a patriotic
ditty, in which the only distinguishable
rhymes were &quot;Black Watch&quot; and &quot;Scotch.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">These revels brought the Hero on to the stage.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
He was attired in clerical dress and a cavalry
helmet; and, sitting down beside the Heroine
upon the sarcophagus, he proceeded, oblivious
of the presence of the entire guard, who were
huddled round the fire not more than five feet
away, to make her a proposal of marriage; quoting
Scripture to some purpose, and extorting a
demure affirmative from the lady just before the
Comic Man, who had obviously been lamenting
that the success of the piece should be imperilled
by such stuff as this, upset the soup-kettle, and so
gave a fresh turn to the proceedings.</p>

<p class="indent">All this time Hughie had been conscious of an
increasing feeling of curiosity as to the identity
of the only member of the glee-party round the
fire who so far had made no contribution to the
entertainment. He darkly suspected him of being
the Villain, though what the Villain should be
doing unrecognised at such a period of the play&mdash;it
was about the third act&mdash;was hard to understand.
However, the mystery was now cleared
up by a French <i>vivandière</i>&mdash;by this time it was
plain that the scene was laid in the Crimea&mdash;who
called upon the mysterious one, in the accents
of Stratford-atte-Bowe, for a song and dance.
No reply being forthcoming, the entire company
(precipitately, but quite correctly, as it happened)
rose up and denounced the stranger as a Russian
and a spy. They had only themselves to blame
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
for his presence, for apparently he had strolled up
and joined the party quite promiscuously; and
no one had thought, so far, of asking him who he
was or even of addressing him.</p>

<p class="indent">The audience now sat up expectantly. But
instead of taking the spy prisoner and shooting
him on sight, the guard hurried off R.U.E.&mdash;possibly
to bring up their big guns or find a policeman.
These deplorable tactics did not meet
with the reward they deserved, for the Villain,
instead of bolting off L. as fast as he could, lingered
upon the stage to tell the audience that he
had come back to have one more go at the Hero.
(Goodness knows how many he had had!) The
Hero obligingly appeared at that moment, and
a section (whose numbers appeared to increase as
the play proceeded) of the audience shouted to
the Villain to cut in and do it <i>now</i>. But portentous
trampings &quot;off&quot; announced the return of the
glee-party, and the Villain, finding that he could
not execute his perfectly justifiable design without
considerable danger to his own person, and
was in fact in a particularly tight place himself,
suddenly appealed (with considerable &quot;nerve,&quot;
it seemed to Hughie) to the Hero, as a Cleric, to
save him. The Hero (who was evidently a fool
as well as a bore) immediately complied. &quot;You
must take upon you my identity,&quot; he remarked.
In a twinkling they had exchanged great-coats,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
and the Villain was now by all the laws of Melodrama
completely disguised as the Hero. He
dashed off L., just as a perfect avalanche of
people, who had been faithfully and increasingly
marking time in the wings, poured on to the stage
R., and endeavoured almost to poke their rifles
into the Hero&#39;s breast. But just as a nervous
female in the audience, apprehensive about the
sudden discharge of firearms, convulsively gripped
Hughie&#39;s left elbow, the Heroine dashed on from
nowhere, and taking her stand before the Hero&mdash;apparently
she was the only person upon the
stage who recognised him&mdash;uttered these thrilling
but mysterious words: &quot;You kennot far erpon
ther Red Kerawss!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Curtain, amid thunders of applause.</p>

<p class="indent">After a commendably short interval the curtain
rose upon the next act. The Hero was now
discovered asleep (under what must have struck
any thoughtful member of the audience as highly
compromising circumstances for a clergyman) in
the cottage of a stout lady in a very short skirt
and fur-topped boots; whom, from the fact that
her opening soliloquy commenced with the words,
&quot;Har, vell!&quot; the audience rightly adjudged to be
a Russian. This lady, it was soon plain, was
consumed by a secret passion for the Hero. In
fact she proclaimed it in such strident tones that
it was surprising that its object did not wake up.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
This scene soon resolved itself into a series of
determined efforts on the part of the Villain to
terminate the existence of the Hero&mdash;an enterprise
in which he by this time commanded the
whole-hearted support of the greater part of the
audience. His first attempt was foiled by the
Comic Man, who entered singing &quot;Keep the baby
warm, Mother!&quot; just as he had crawled within
striking distance of the unwakeable Hero. Muttering
curses, the unfortunate man announced his
intention of retiring &quot;to the woods,&quot; pending another
opportunity. But he had no luck. Just as
the Comic Man performed a humorous exit
through the window, the stout lady&mdash;most of
the other characters, by the way, addressed her
as &quot;Tinker&quot;: possibly her name was Katinka&mdash;came
in through the door, filled with the forebodings
of what she called &quot;loove.&quot; Her subsequent
course of action could certainly only have
been condoned on the plea of emotional insanity.
She unceremoniously bundled the Hero out
of bed&mdash;fortunately he had gone there in his
boots&mdash;and sent him off on a transparent wild-goose
chase to the &quot;trenches.&quot; Then she got into
bed herself, and when the Villain came crawling
back from &quot;the woods,&quot; brandishing his knife in
the limelight, the audience were treated to a sort
of up-to-date rendering of &quot;Little Red Riding
Hood,&quot; the part of the Wolf being sustained by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
Katinka, and that of Red Riding Hood by the
now hopelessly demoralised Villain, who was once
more chased back to his arboreal lurking-place
with the muzzle of a revolver in the small of his
back.</p>

<p class="indent">In the next and final act the Villain made a
supreme effort. He began by slaying the drummer-boy,&mdash;presumably
to keep his hand in,&mdash;but
on going through his victim&#39;s pockets in
search of certain &quot;despatches&quot; which that youthful
hero had undertaken to carry through the
Russian lines,&mdash;where to, heaven knows!&mdash;the
unfortunate man discovered a locket, which
instantly revealed to him the surprising, but none
the less distressing, intelligence that he had slain
his own son. His anguish was pitiful to behold,
and when the Hero came on and began to rub
it in by further excerpts from the Scriptures, the
audience to a man decided that if the Villain
brought it off this time no jury would convict,
but that he would be bound over at the most.
He certainly set about the business with more
gumption than usual. Waiting until the Hero
was well launched into &quot;Secondly,&quot; with the
limelight full in his eyes, he once more produced
the glittering knife. Suddenly the ubiquitous
Katinka dashed on, and in the most unsportsmanlike
manner shot the Villain in the small of
the back, at a range of about eighteen inches. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
dropped dead across the body of his son (which
must have hurt that infant prodigy very much).
All the other characters sidled on from the wings
and formed a grand concluding tableau, the Hero,
egregious to the last and entwined in a stained-glass
attitude with the Hospital Nurse, pronouncing
a sort of benediction as the curtain fell.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Doesn&#39;t this remind you of the Drama as it
used to be dished up to the undergraduates in
the old Barn at Cambridge?&quot; remarked a voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie turned to the speaker. He found beside
him a man of about thirty, with a fair moustache,
which half hid a weak but amiable mouth and a
receding chin. He was dressed in the thick blue
shore-going garments of the seaman, but he
looked too slight for an A.B. and too clean for a
fireman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Deck-hand,&quot; said Hughie to himself. &quot;Gentleman
once&mdash;no, still!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo!&quot; he replied. &quot;You seem to know me.
Forgive me if I ought to know you, but I can&#39;t
fix you at present. Odd thing, too, because I
don&#39;t often forget a face.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was up at Cambridge in your time,&quot; said
the man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not Benedict&#39;s?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No&mdash;Trinity. I was sent down ultimately.
But I knew you well by sight. Often saw you in the
boat, and so on. You&#39;re Marrable, aren&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
&quot;Yes. Were you a rowing man?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. I hunted with the Drag and rode at
Cottenham&mdash;in those days.&quot; He glanced philosophically
at his present attire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come and have something,&quot; said Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">The man interested him. He might, of course,
be a mere long-shore shark on the make, or he
might be what he looked&mdash;a good-hearted, well-born
waster&mdash;an incorrigible but contented failure.
Anyhow, five minutes over a friendly glass
would probably settle the question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder if it&#39;s possible to obtain a decent
British drink in this clam-ridden hole,&quot; Hughie
continued.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The nearest thing to a product of the British
Empire that you&#39;ll get here,&quot; said the man, &quot;is
Canadian whisky; and personally I would rather
drink nitric acid. We had better stick to
lager. Come along: I know the ropes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Presently they found themselves in a German
beer saloon, where a stertorous Teuton supplied
their needs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By the way,&quot; said the man, &quot;I have the advantage
of you. My name is Allerton. Sorry I
forgot!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thanks,&quot; said Hughie, rather lamely. &quot;Are
you&mdash;living out here just now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Allerton simply. &quot;I&#39;m a deck-hand
on a tramp-steamer.&quot; He spoke easily and freely,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
as one gentleman to another. He had realised
at a glance that he was not about to be made the
victim of offensive curiosity or misplaced charity.
&quot;She&#39;s lying at Hoboken, due out on Tuesday,
for Bordeaux.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;French boat?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. American owned, under the British flag,
by a fairly competent rascal, too. This trip we
are carrying a cargo of Californian wine of sorts.
We took it last week from a sailing barque that
had brought it round the Horn. She wanted to
start back at once, so turned it over to us
cheap.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you&#39;re going to Bordeaux? What does
your astute owner want to take coals to Newcastle
for?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because everything that comes <i>out</i> of Newcastle
is labelled coal whether it is coal or not.
In other words, this poison will be carried by us
to Bordeaux, bottled and sealed, and shipped to
England as fine vintage Burgundy. John Bull
will drink it and feel none the worse. I&#39;m told
it&#39;s a paying trade.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish I were going in your boat,&quot; said
Hughie, rather regretfully. &quot;I&#39;m booked by the
Apulia.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, look out for the Orinoco on your second
day out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Orinoco? I remember seeing her at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
Hoboken to-day, and wishing I could make the
trip on her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I doubt if you&#39;d be of the same opinion after
trying conclusions with Mr. James Gates, our
first &#39;greaser,&#39;&quot; replied Allerton. &quot;Still, I don&#39;t
know,&quot; he continued, regarding Hughie&#39;s brawny
form reflectively. &quot;I don&#39;t believe he could put
the fear of death into you the way he does into
most of us. You&#39;ve knocked about a bit in your
time, I dare say, only with more success than I.
Perhaps you weren&#39;t born with holes in <i>all</i> your
pockets.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say,&quot; said Hughie rather diffidently,&mdash;it is
difficult to confer a favour upon a man who is
down without offending him,&mdash;&quot;will you dine
with me? Or sup, as it&#39;s getting late?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall be charmed,&quot; said the deck-hand.
&quot;Shall I show you a place? I know quite a comfortable
establishment close by here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie said &quot;Righto!&quot; and presently they
found themselves in the place of entertainment
selected by Allerton. Most of the room was occupied
by small tables, at which various couples
were eating and drinking. At one end was a
platform, upon which an intermittent sort of variety
entertainment was in progress.</p>

<p class="indent">On the floor at the foot of the platform was
a piano. At the piano sat a girl, who accompanied
the performers and bridged over the gaps in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
the programme by selections from the less restrained
works of American Masters of Music.
Not far from the stage an unhealthy-looking
youth was presiding over a bar. The atmosphere
was something between that of a smoking-concert,
and Baker Street Station in the days of the old
Underground.</p>

<p class="indent">Allerton&#39;s lazy nonchalance lasted until the first
course was set before him by a smiling blackamoor,
and then, with a half-apologetic aside to
his host on the subject of his last meal, he fell
upon the fare in a manner which brought very
vividly home to Hughie&#39;s intelligence the difference
between an amateur casual like himself,
with money enough in his pocket to make it possible
to knock off when he tired of the game, and
the genuine article. He was not hungry, having
in fact dined a couple of hours before; but he did
his best by tactful pecking to conceal the fact
from his guest. Still, even after he had ordered
some wine and duly inspected the cork, he had a
good deal of time to look about him.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently his attention began to concentrate
itself upon the girl at the piano. She was sitting
quite near him, and Hughie, always respectfully
appreciative where a pretty face was concerned,&mdash;his
wanderings, though they had made him
more than ever a master of men, had done little
to eradicate his innate attitude of quiet, determined,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
and occasionally quite undeserved reverence
towards women,&mdash;had time to notice the
un-American freshness of her colouring, the regularity
of her profile, and the prettiness of her
hair. He also observed that the foot which rested
upon the pedal of the piano was small and shapely.
She was quietly dressed, in a dark-blue serge
skirt and a white silk blouse&mdash;or &quot;shirtwaist,&quot;
to employ the mysterious local designation&mdash;with
short sleeves. She had round arms and good hands.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie wondered what she was doing in a place
like this, and, young-man-like, felt vaguely unhappy
on her behalf; but experienced a truly
British feeling of relief (mingled with slight disappointment)
on observing that she wore a wedding-ring.
He waxed sentimental. Who was her
husband? he wondered. He hoped it was not the
proprietor of the establishment,&mdash;a greasy individual
of Semitic appearance, who occasionally
found leisure, in the intervals between announcing
the &quot;turns&quot; and calling the attention of patrons
to the exceptional resources of the bar, to walk
across the room and paw the girl affectionately
on the shoulder while giving her some direction
as to the music,&mdash;nor yet the scorbutic young
man behind the bar.</p>

<p class="indent">His meditations were interrupted by Allerton.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Marrable, eyes front! And fill up your glass.
Hang it, drink fair!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
Hughie turned and regarded his guest. The
greater part of a magnum of vitriolic champagne
had disappeared down that gentleman&#39;s throat.
His eye had brightened, and now twinkled facetiously
as he surveyed first Hughie and then the
girl at the piano.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Une petite pièce de tout droit</i>&mdash;eh, what?&quot; he
remarked.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie, beginning to understand why his companion
was now swabbing decks instead of ruling
ancestral acres, nodded shortly.</p>

<p class="indent">Allerton noticed his host&#39;s momentary distance
of manner, and leaned across the table with an
air of contrition.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m afraid,&quot; he said apologetically, &quot;that I&#39;m
getting most infernally full. You see how it is
with me, don&#39;t you? I&#39;m that sort of bloke. Always
have been, from a nipper. Thash&mdash;That&#39;s
why I&#39;m here. It&#39;s a pity. And the worst of it
is,&quot; he added, in a sudden burst of candour, &quot;that
I&#39;m going to get much fuller. It&#39;s a long time
since I tasted this.&quot; He touched his glass. &quot;It
isn&#39;t served out on the Orinoco. Do you&mdash;er&mdash;mind?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie, with a queer feeling of compassion,
smiled reassuringly, and ordered another bottle.
If Allerton was about to get drunk, he should get
drunk like a gentleman for once in a way.</p>

<p class="indent">Then his attention reverted to the piano.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
There had been a development. The girl was
mechanically playing one of the compositions of
that delicate weaver of subtle harmonies, Mr.
John Philip Sousa; but she was not reading her
music. Her eyelids were resolutely lowered, as if
she wished to avoid seeing something. The reason
resolved itself into a gentleman who was leaning
over the front of the piano, gazing amorously
down upon the musician, and endeavouring, with
surprising success, to make himself heard above
one of the composer&#39;s most characteristic efforts.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie looked him up and down. He was a
big man, powerfully built, with little pig&#39;s eyes
set close together, and a ponderous and vicious-looking
lower jaw. Was <i>he</i> her husband? wondered
the deeply interested Hughie. No: he was
too obviously endeavouring to make himself
agreeable.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Marrable, my son,&quot; suddenly interpolated the
convivial but observant Allerton, &quot;you&#39;re cut
out! No use bidding against that customer. Do
you know who he is?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. Who?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That,&quot; replied the deck-hand with an air of
almost proprietary pride, &quot;is Noddy Kinahan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! And who may he be?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gee! (Sorry! One picks up these rotten Yankee
expressions somehow.) I mean, I am surprised
you haven&#39;t heard of him. He&#39;s rather a big man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
here. In fact, to be explish&mdash;explicit,&quot;&mdash;Mr.
Allerton was fast arriving at that stage of intoxication
which cannot let well alone, but must
tempt Providence by dragging in unnecessarily
hard words,&mdash;&quot;he is my employer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anything else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Political boss of sorts. <i>Inter alia</i>&mdash;that&#39;s
good! I&#39;m glad I remembered that. <i>Inter alia</i>
rhymes with Australia, doesn&#39;t it? We&#39;ll make
up a Limerick on it some time&mdash;let me see,
where was I? Oh, yesh&mdash;yes, I mean&mdash;<i>inter
alia</i>, he owns the Orinoco and about a dozen
more mouldy old coffins; and very well he does
out of them, too! Buys them cheap, and&mdash;but
excuse further details at present, ole man. To tell
you the truth I&#39;m getting so screwed that I&#39;m
afraid of saying something that in my calmer moments
I shall subsequently regret. A cigar? I
thank you. You&#39;re a white man, Marrable.
Chin chin!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After this burst of discretion Mr. Allerton returned
to the joint worship of Bacchus and Vesta,
the difficulty which he experienced in keeping
the lighted end of the cigar out of his mouth increasing
as the evening advanced, but leaving
his cheerfulness unimpaired. His condition was
due not so much to the depths of his potations
as to the shallowness of his accommodation for
the same; and strong-headed Hughie, as he surveyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
the weak chin and receding forehead on
the other side of the table, mused not altogether
without envy upon the strange inequality of that
law of nature which decrees that what is a toothful
for one man shall be a skinful for another and
an anæsthetic for a third.</p>

<p class="indent">He was recalled from these musings by the remembrance
of the girl at the piano, and turned
to see what was happening now.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Noddy Kinahan was returning from an
expedition to the bar, carrying a bottle of champagne
and a long tumbler. These accessories to
conviviality he placed on the top of the piano,
and departed on a second trip, returning shortly
with a wine-glassful of brandy. The girl, though
she probably observed more of his movements
than her low-drooping lashes would seem to allow,
made no sign, but continued to play the ragtime
tune with a mechanical precision which
caused the tumbler on the top of the piano to tread
a lively and self-accompanied measure round its
more stolid and heavily weighted companion.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Kinahan next proceeded to pour himself
out a tumblerful of champagne, liberally lacing
the foaming liquid with brandy. Then, with an
ingratiating gesture toward the shrinking girl,
he proceeded to swallow the mixture with every
appearance of enjoyment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;King&#39;s peg!&quot; commented Hughie to himself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
&quot;Wonder how much of <i>that</i> he can stand? I&#39;d
back him against friend Allerton, though, if it
came&mdash;Hallo! The hound! This must stop!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He half rose to his feet. Mr. Kinahan, having
satisfied his present needs, had refilled the tumbler
with champagne, added the rest of the brandy,
and was now proffering the potion, in the self-same
vessel which he had just honoured with his
own august lips, to the girl at the piano.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl turned crimson and shook her head,
but kept on playing.</p>

<p class="indent">Noddy Kinahan was not accustomed to bestow
favours in vain. He walked round behind the
piano, and, taking the girl firmly by the shoulders
with his left arm, held the sizzling tumbler to her
lips. She uttered a strangled cry, left off playing,
and struggled frantically to seize the glass with
her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">Now Hughie Marrable had a healthy prejudice
in favour of minding his own business. He had
witnessed scenes of this description before, and
he knew that, place and company considered, the
girl at the piano was probably not unaccustomed
to accept refreshment at the hands of gentlemen,
even when the gentleman was half-drunk, the
hands dirty, and the refreshment (after allowing
a generous discount for spillings) sufficiently
potent to deprive any ordinary woman, within
ten minutes, of any sort of control over her own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
actions or behaviour. Moreover, Hughie had a
truly British horror of a scene. <i>But</i>&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">He was surprised to feel himself leap from his
chair and bound toward the piano. His surprise,
however, was nothing to that experienced a moment
later by Mr. Noddy Kinahan, who, having
succeeded in pinning the desperately resisting
girl&#39;s arms to her sides, was now endeavouring
to prise her lips open with the edge of the tumbler.
But there are slips even after the cup has
reached the lip. Just as success appeared to be
about to crown Mr. Kinahan&#39;s hospitable efforts,
a large and sinewy hand shot over his right shoulder
and snatched away the glass, which it threw
under the piano. Simultaneously an unseen force
in the rear shook him till his teeth rattled, and
then, depressing his head to the level of the keyboard,
began to play a lively if staccato tune
thereon with the point of Mr. Kinahan&#39;s rubicund
and fleshy nose.</p>

<p class="indent">These operations were more or less screened
from the public view by the body of the piano,
which was an &quot;upright&quot; of the cottage variety.
But the sudden cessation of &quot;The Washington
Post&quot; in favour of what sounded like &quot;The Cat&#39;s
Polka&quot; played by a baby with its feet, brought
the proprietor of the establishment hurrying
across the room. He arrived just in time to be
present at the conclusion of a florid chromatic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
scale of about four octaves, executed under the
guidance of Hughie Marrable&#39;s heavy hand by
Mr. Kinahan&#39;s somewhat abraded nasal organ.</p>

<p class="indent">The instrumental part of the entertainment
now terminated in favour of a vocal interlude.
Hughie released his grip of Mr. Noddy Kinahan&#39;s
collar, and stood back a pace waiting for a rush.
He was confident that, given a clear floor and no
interference, he could offer his burly opponent a
lesson in manners which he would never forget.</p>

<p class="indent">But Mr. Kinahan, being a mover in high political
altitudes, was not in the habit of doing his
own dirty work. He reviled his opponent, it is
true, in terms which an expert could not but have
admitted were masterly, but it was obvious to
the unruffled Hughie that he was doing so chiefly
to keep his courage up and &quot;save his face.&quot; There
was a cunning, calculating look in his piggy eyes
which did not quite fit in with the unrestrained
<i>abandon</i> of his utterances, and Hughie began to
realise that there are deeper schemes of retaliation
than mere assault and battery.</p>

<p class="indent">Once or twice Mr. Kinahan, in pausing for
breath, turned and looked over his shoulder toward
the curious crowd which was gathering behind
him. Presently Hughie noticed a couple of
&quot;toughs&quot; of the most uncompromisingly villainous
appearance advancing in a leisurely fashion
from a corner by the door, where they had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
supping. They kept their eyes on Kinahan, as if
for an order. Evidently that great man never
took his walks abroad without his jackals.</p>

<p class="indent">Things were beginning to look serious. The
Hebraic proprietor, half crazy with fright at the
gratuitous advertisement which the fracas was
conferring upon his establishment,&mdash;an advertisement
which was receiving a gratifying response
from an influx of curious sightseers,&mdash;was frantically
begging people to go away. The girl, the
source (as ever!) of all the trouble, was still sitting
on the music-stool, trembling like a fluttered
bird, with Hughie, feeling slightly self-conscious,
standing over her. In the middle distance, Mr.
Allerton, gloriously oblivious to the ephemeral
and irrelevant disturbance around him, sat contentedly
before two empty bottles, endeavouring
with erratic fingers to adorn the lapel of his
blue pea-jacket with a silver-plated fork (the
property of the establishment), upon which he
had impaled a nodding banana of pantomimic
proportions.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly Hughie heard himself addressed in
casual tones by some one standing close behind
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say, Johnny Bull, you&#39;d best get out of here,
right now. Skip! Those two toughs of Noddy&#39;s
won&#39;t touch you till they get the word, but when
they do you&#39;ll be sorry. Get out this way, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
the side of the stage. It leads around to the back
door.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Having delivered himself of this undoubtedly
sound piece of advice, the unhealthy-looking
young gentleman from behind the bar picked up
the champagne bottle and broken glass, and
lounged back to his base of operations.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie, realising the wisdom of his words, and
making a hasty note that one should never judge
even a mottle-faced bar-tender by his appearance,
reluctantly abandoned his half-projected scheme
of hurling Noddy Kinahan into the arms of his
two sinister supporters and then knocking their
collective heads together, and turned to the small
door behind him. Suddenly he caught sight of
the piano-girl. He paused and surveyed her
thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;d better come with me,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">Without a word, the girl rose and preceded
him to the door. Hughie opened it for her, and
they both passed through and hurried down a
narrow passage, which gave direct into the alley
at the back of the establishment.</p>

<p class="indent">Once outside, Hughie took the girl&#39;s arm and
fairly ran, never pausing till they reached the
brightly lighted sea-front. He had an idea that
a cheerful and crowded thoroughfare would prove
more salubrious than deserted and ill-lit byways.</p>

<p class="indent">Once clear of their late surroundings the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
slackened pace, and Hughie surveyed his charge
with comical perplexity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now what am I to do with <i>you</i>?&quot; he inquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take me home,&quot; said the girl, sobbing.</p>

<p class="indent">Her pluck and fortitude, having brought her
dry-eyed through the worst of the conflict, had
now taken their usual leave of absence, and she
was indulging very properly in a few reactionary
and comforting tears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where do you live?&quot; asked Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Brooklyn.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s a matter for a trolley-car. Come
along.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He took her arm again, rather diffidently this
time,&mdash;his old masculine self-consciousness was
returning,&mdash;and hurried off to what the Coney
Islanders call a &quot;deepo.&quot; Here they ensconced
themselves in the corner of a fairly empty car,
and started on their twenty-mile run, <i>viâ</i> Sheepshead
Bay and other delectable spots, to Brooklyn
Bridge.</p>

<p class="indent">As soon as the car started, Hughie turned to
his companion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look here,&quot; he said bluntly. &quot;I know a lady
when I meet one. What were you doing in that
place at all? You are English, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. I can&#39;t blame you for wondering. I&#39;ll
tell you. I come from London. My father was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
a small schoolmaster in Sydenham. He&mdash;he was
unfortunate, and died three years ago, and I was
left alone in the world, with hardly two sixpences
to rub together. Just as things were looking
none too promising for me, I met and married&quot;&mdash;she
flushed proudly&mdash;&quot;one of the best men
that ever stepped&mdash;Dennis Maclear. He is an
electrical engineer. We came out here together
to make our fortunes, and settled in New York.
We were beginning to do fairly well after a long
struggle, when one day Dennis crushed his left
arm and leg in a cog-wheel arrangement of some
kind, and for three months he has not been able
even to get out of bed without help. Bad luck,
wasn&#39;t it? He is getting better slowly, and some
day, the doctor says, he will be able to get about
again. But&mdash;well, savings don&#39;t last for ever,
you know; so I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see,&quot; said Hughie; &quot;the upkeep of the establishment
has devolved on you in the meanwhile?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Piano-playing is about the only accomplishment
I possess. A girl friend of mine told me
she was giving up her billet at old Bercotti&#39;s,
and asked if I would like it. She wouldn&#39;t recommend
it to most girls, she said, but perhaps
it would suit me all right, being married. I took
it; but as you saw, my being married wasn&#39;t
sufficient protection after all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
She shuddered, for she was very young, and
badly shaken; but presently she smiled bravely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did you get?&quot; asked Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dollar a night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s not much.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s better than starvation,&quot; said practical
little Mrs. Maclear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what are you going to do next?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not going back to old Bercotti&#39;s again&mdash;that&#39;s
flat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you get another berth?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, if there happens to be anybody in this
simple and confiding country who is willing to
take on as accompanist or teacher a young woman
of shabby-genteel appearance, who is unable to
mention a single soul as a reference, and has no
character to show from her former employer&mdash;it
ought to be easy!&quot; said the girl.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie regarded her reflectively.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You take it well. I admire your pluck,&quot; he
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A married woman with a husband to keep
has no time to worry about pluck,&quot; replied Mrs.
Maclear; &quot;she just <i>has</i> to do things. Besides, all
the pluck in the world can&#39;t save a woman when
Noddy Kinahan is about. If it hadn&#39;t been for
you&mdash;by the way, would you mind telling me
your name? You know mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie told her. Presently they left the trolley-car&mdash;<i>anglicè</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
electric-tram&mdash;and struck off
down a street in Brooklyn. The girl turned in at
a doorway, and paused at the foot of a stair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Won&#39;t you come up and see my husband, Mr.
Marrable?&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s ten flights up, and
we don&#39;t run to an elevator; but I know Dennis
would like to thank you himself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie had intended to refuse,&mdash;he hated
being thanked as much as most matter-of-fact
people,&mdash;but, a flash of unusual insight revealing
to him the fact that the true object of the invitation
was not to exhibit him to the husband,
but to enable this proud little lady to exhibit her
husband to him, he felt reassured, and allowed
himself to be borne aloft to the Maclear eyrie.
Here a gigantic and impulsive son of Kerry,
gaunt and hollow-eyed through long bed-keeping,
wrung his hand in a manner which made him
feel glad he was not a refractory terminal, what
time Mrs. Maclear, in a sort of up-to-date version
of the song of Miriam, described Hughie&#39;s glorious
triumph over Noddy Kinahan, laying special
stress upon the ecstatic period during which Mr.
Kinahan, at the instance of Hughie, had enacted
the part of a human pianola.</p>

<p class="indent">He left them at last, wondering in his heart,
as he tramped home under the stars to his hotel
in West Forty-Second Street, what the plucky
couple were going to live on during the next two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
or three months. The man was still practically
a cripple,&mdash;he must have been badly mangled,&mdash;and
it is hard work fighting for time in a country
whose motto, as regards human as well as
other machinery, is: &quot;Never repair! Scrap, and
replace!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie had solved the problem to his satisfaction
by the time he crossed Brooklyn Bridge.</p>

<p class="indent">For the rest of the way home he thought of
other things. A bachelor, however ungregarious,
is at heart a sentimental animal, and during his
walk Hughie was contemplating with his mind&#39;s
eye the picture that he had left behind him as
he said good-night,&mdash;the picture of &quot;a snug little
kingdom up ten pair of stairs,&quot; tenanted by a
little community of two, self-contained and self-sufficient,
dauntless in the face of grim want and
utter friendlessness,&mdash;and, despite his own
health and wealth, he experienced a sudden feeling
of envy for the crippled and impecunious
Dennis Maclear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose,&quot; he mused to himself, &quot;it doesn&#39;t
really matter <i>how</i> rotten a time you have in this
world so long as you have it in the right company.&quot;
Then he added, apparently as a sort of
corollary: &quot;By gad, when I get home next week,
I&#39;ll <i>stay</i> there!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But, however carefully (or carelessly) we handle
the tiller on life&#39;s voyage, it is the little casual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
currents and unexpected side winds that really
set our course for us. As Hughie rolled into bed
that night he reflected, rather regretfully, that
the incident of that evening was closed for ever.
He had definitely cut himself off from the Maclears,
at any rate, for the very simple reason that
he had just posted to them a hundred one-dollar
notes, as a temporary loan until their &quot;ship came
in,&quot; carefully omitting to mention that his own
was due to go out in twenty-four hours, and giving
no address for purposes of repayment.</p>

<p class="indent">But for all that, the incident had definitely altered
his course for him, or at any rate was destined
to send him round by an alternative route.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chVII" id="chVII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="h3">THE ALTERNATIVE ROUTE</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Her</span> most ardent admirers&mdash;and they had
never been very numerous&mdash;could hardly have
described the Orinoco as a rapid or up-to-date
vessel. She could average a fair eight knots in ordinary
weather (except when the Chief Engineer
was not sober; and then she had been known to
do as much as eleven), and she had faced with
tolerable credit seven strenuous years of North
Atlantic weather, winter and summer alike. But
she was no flier.</p>

<p class="indent">She had not always ploughed the ocean at the
behests of Mr. Noddy Kinahan, her present owner.
As a matter of fact, she dated back to the early
sixties. She had been built on the Clyde, in days
when people were not in such a hurry as they are
now, for steady and reliable cross-channel service
between Scotland and Ireland; and the crinolined
young lady who had blushingly performed the
christening ceremony as the brand-new steamer
slipped down the ways had named her the Gareloch.</p>

<p class="indent">After fifteen years of honest buffeting between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
the Kish and the Cloch the little Gareloch had
been pronounced too slow, and sold to the proprietor
of a line of coasting steamers which plied
between Cardiff and London. In this capacity,
with a different-coloured funnel and a slightly
decayed interior, she had served for nine years as
the Annie S. Holmes. After that an officious
gentleman from the Board of Trade happened to
notice the state of her boilers, and unhesitatingly
declined to renew her certificate until various
things were done which her present owner was not
in the habit of doing. Consequently she had lain
rusting in Southampton Water for six months,
until an astute Scot, who ran a sort of Dr. Barnardo&#39;s
home for steamers which had been abandoned
by their original owners, stepped in and
bought her, at the rate of about a pound per ton;
and having refitted her with some convenient
boilers which he had picked up at a sale, and
checked her fuel-consumption by reducing her
grate-area, set her going again in a humble but
remunerative way as a pig-boat between Limerick
and Glasgow. During this period of her career
she was known as the Blush Rose&mdash;and probably
smelt as sweet.</p>

<p class="indent">The maritime Dr. Barnardo sold her three years
later (at a profit) to a gentleman who required a
ship for some shady and mysterious operations
amid certain islands in the Southern Pacific. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
nature of the poor Blush Rose&#39;s occupation may
be gathered from the fact that in the space of
three months she made those already tropical
regions too hot to hold her; and, with her name
painted out, a repaired shot-hole in her counter,
and a few pearl oyster-shells sticking out here and
there in the murky recesses of her hold, was
knocked down for a song at Buenos Ayres to a
Spanish-American who desired her for the fulfilment
of some rather private contracts, into which
he had entered with a Central American State, for
a consignment of small arms and ammunition
delivered immediately&mdash;terms, C. O. D. and no
questions asked. Her captain on this occasion
was a Lowland Scot of disreputable character
but inherent piety, who endeavoured to confer
a rather spurious sanctity upon a nefarious enterprise
by christening his nameless vessel the
Jedburgh Abbey. But, alas! the Jedburgh Abbey
was confiscated a year later by the United States
government, and having disgorged a most uncanonical
cargo, was knocked down by Dutch
auction, without benefit of clergy, to the highest
bidder. Competition for her possession was not
keen, and she ultimately became the property
of Mr. Noddy Kinahan, who at that time was
beginning to pile up a considerable fortune by
purchasing old steamers on their way to the scrap-heap
and running them as tramp-freighters until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
they sank. The Jedburgh Abbey, with a new
propeller,&mdash;she had gone short of a blade for
years,&mdash;her rusty carcase tinkered into something
like sea-worthiness, and her engines secured
a little more firmly to their bed-plates, had re-established
her social status by creeping once more
into Lloyd&#39;s list&mdash;the Red Book of the Mercantile
Marine&mdash;and, disguised as the Orinoco, of
the &quot;River&quot; Line of freight-carrying steamships,
had served Mr. Noddy Kinahan well for seven
years. This grey morning, with Sandy Hook well
down below the western horizon, she clambered
wearily but perseveringly over the Atlantic rollers,
like a disillusioned and world-weary old cab-horse
which, having begun life between the shafts of a
gentleman&#39;s brougham, is now concluding a
depressing existence by dragging a funereal
&quot;growler&quot; up and down the undulations of a
London suburb.</p>

<p class="indent">Her redeeming feature was a certain purity of
outline and symmetry of form. She boasted a
flush deck, unbroken by any unsightly waist amid-ships;
and not even her unscraped masts, her
scarred sides, and her flaked and salt-whitened
funnel could altogether take away from her her
pride of race,&mdash;the right to boast, in common
with many a human derelict of the same sex and
a very similar history, that she had &quot;been a lady
once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
She had now been at sea for well over twenty-four
hours, and her crew, who had to a man been
brought on board in what a sympathetic eyewitness
on a similar occasion once described as &quot;a
state of beastly but enviable intoxication,&quot; were
once more beginning to sit up and take notice.
Their efforts in this direction owed much to the
kind assistance of Messrs. Gates and Dingle, the
first and second mates, who with cold douche and
unrelenting boot were sparing no pains to rouse
to a sense of duty those of their flock who had not
yet found or recovered their sea-legs.</p>

<p class="indent">The crew consisted of two Englishmen and a
Californian, together with a handful of Scandinavians,
Portuguese, and Germans, divided by
sea-law (which, like its big brother, <i>non curat de
minimis</i>) into &quot;Dagoes&quot; and &quot;Dutchmen&quot; respectively,
representatives of the Romance races
being grouped under the former and of the Anglo-Saxon
under the latter designations. With one
exception none of them had sailed on the ship
before, and in all probability would never do so
again. They had been purveyed to Captain Kingdom
by a Tenderloin boarding-house keeper, and
had signed a contract for the voyage to Bordeaux
and back, wages for both trips to be paid
at the end of the second. If sufficiently knocked
about, they would in all probability desert at
Bordeaux, preferring to forego their pay rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
than stand a second dose of the home comforts
of the Orinoco. This was one of the ways in
which Captain Kingdom saved his employer
money and in which Mr. Noddy Kinahan made
the &quot;River&quot; Line a profitable concern. There
were also others, which shall be set forth in due
course.</p>

<p class="indent">Captain Kingdom had just appeared on the
bridge. He was a furtive and sinister-looking individual,
resembling rather a pawnbroker&#39;s assistant
than one who occupied his business in
great waters. But he was a useful servant to
Noddy Kinahan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Got all the hands to work, Mr. Gates?&quot; he
called down to the mate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aye, aye, sir!&quot; replied Mr. Gates, knocking
the heel of his boot on the deck to ease his aching
toes.</p>

<p class="indent">The captain ran his eye over the crew, who
were huddling together forward of the bridge.
He cleared his throat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, you scum,&quot; he began genially, &quot;attend
to me, while I tell you what you&#39;ve got to do on
board this ship.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The scum, stagnant and unresponsive, listened
stolidly to his harangue, the substance of which
did not differ materially, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, from
one of Mr. Squeers&#39;s inaugural addresses to his
pupils on the first morning of term at Dotheboys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
Hall. Captain Kingdom&#39;s peroration laid particular
stress upon the fact that Messrs. Gates and
Dingle had been requested by him as a particular
favour to adopt the policy of the thick stick
and the big boot in the case of those members
of the crew who refrained from looking slick in
executing their orders.</p>

<p class="indent">The crew received his remarks with sheepish
grins or sullen scowls; and the orator concluded:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pick watches, Mr. Gates, and then we&#39;ll pipe
down to dinner. Are all hands on deck?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aye, aye, sir,&quot; replied Mr. Gates, looking over
his list.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I saw <i>somebody</i> down below a few minutes
ago,&quot; drawled a voice, proceeding from a figure
seated upon a bollard.</p>

<p class="indent">It was Mr. Allerton, who, with characteristic
contentment with (or indifference to) his lot, had
performed the unprecedented feat of signing on
for a second voyage in the Orinoco. He wore his
usual air of humorous tolerance of the cares of
this world, and spoke in the composed and unruffled
fashion which stamps the high-caste Englishman
all over the globe. His lot on board the
Orinoco had been lighter than that of most, for
his companions, finding him apparently impervious
to ill-usage and philosophically genial under
all circumstances, had agreed to regard him
as a species of heavily decayed and slightly demented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
&quot;dude,&quot; and had half-affectionately
christened him &quot;Percy,&quot;&mdash;a term which sums up
the typical Englishman for the New Yorker almost
as vividly as &quot;Rosbif&quot; and &quot;Godam&quot; perform
that office for the Parisian.</p>

<p class="indent">The captain descended from the bridge, walked
across the deck, and dispassionately kicked Mr.
Allerton off the bollard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stand up, you swine, when you speak to me!&quot;
he shouted. &quot;Where did you see anybody?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Allerton rose slowly and painfully from the
scuppers. There are moments when the <i>rôle</i> of
a Democritus is difficult to sustain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m sorry you did that, captain,&quot; he remarked,
&quot;because I know you didn&#39;t mean it personally.
You had to make some sort of demonstration,
of course, to put the fear of death into these new
hands, but I regret that you should have singled
me out as the <i>corpus vile</i>,&mdash;you don&#39;t know what
that means, I daresay: never mind!&mdash;because
you have shaken up my wits so much, besides
nearly breaking my hip-bone, that I shall have
to pause and consider a minute before I remember
where I <i>did</i> see the gentleman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">If the captain had been Mr. Gates he would
probably have felled Allerton to the deck a second
time. As it was, he shuffled his feet uncomfortably
and glared. The broken man before him,
when all was said and done, was his superior;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
and the captain, who was of sufficiently refined
clay to be sensitive to social distinctions, was angrily
conscious of that sense of sheepish uneasiness
which obsesses the cad, however exalted, in
the presence of a gentleman, however degraded.</p>

<p class="indent">Allerton continued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I remember now, captain. The man was lying
in the alley-way leading to the companion. I&#39;ll
go and see how he is getting on. Keep your seats,
gentlemen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He dived down the fore-hatchway, just in time
to escape the itching boot of the unimpressionable
Mr. Gates, and proceeded between decks toward
the stern. Presently he came to the alley-way in
question. The man was still there, but had
slightly shifted his position since Allerton had
last seen him. He was now reclining across the
passage, with his head sunk on his chest. His
feet were bare, and he was attired in a blue jumper
and a pair of trousers which had once belonged
to a suit of orange-and-red pyjamas. His appearance
was not impressive.</p>

<p class="indent">Allerton stirred him gently with his foot.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wake up, old man,&quot; he remarked, &quot;or
there&#39;ll be hell&mdash;Well, I&#39;m damned!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For the man had drowsily lifted his heavy head
and displayed the features of Hughie Marrable.</p>

<p class="indent">They gazed at each other for a full minute.
Then Allerton said feebly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
&quot;You&#39;ve preferred the Orinoco to the Apulia
after all, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie did not reply. He was running his
tongue round his cracked and blackened lips, and
tentatively sucking his palate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know that taste,&quot; he remarked. &quot;It reminds
me of a night I once spent in Canton. I have it&mdash;opium!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he tenderly fingered the back of his head,
and nodded with the interested air of one who
is acquiring a new item of experience.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve been filled up with opium before,&quot; he
said, &quot;but this is the first time I&#39;ve been sand-bagged.
I suppose I was sand-bagged first and
hocussed afterwards. Yes, that&#39;s it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He looked almost pleased. He was a man who
liked to get to the bottom of things. Presently he
continued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Could you get me a drink of water? I&#39;ve got
a tongue like a stick of glue.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Allerton departed as bidden, presently to return
with a pannikin. Hughie was standing up in the
alley-way, swaying unsteadily and regarding his
attire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say,&quot; he said, after gulping the water,
&quot;would you mind telling me&mdash;you see, I&#39;m a
little bit wuzzy in the head at present&mdash;where
the devil I am, and whether I came on board in
this kit or my own clothes?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
&quot;Steamship Orinoco,&quot; replied Allerton precisely,
&quot;out of New York, for Bordeaux.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me think,&quot; said Hughie,&mdash;&quot;Orinoco?
Ah! now I&#39;m beginning to see daylight. What&#39;s
the name of the owner, our friend from Coney
Island?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Allerton told him. &quot;But he&#39;s more than your
friend now,&quot; he added; &quot;he&#39;s your employer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie whistled long and low.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see,&quot; he said. &quot;Shanghaied&mdash;eh? Well, I
must say he owed me one: I fairly barked his nose
for him that night. But now that he has had me
knocked on the head and shipped on board this
old ark, I think he has overpaid me. I owe him
one again; and, with any luck, he shall have it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you remember being slugged?&quot; said Allerton.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can&#39;t say I do precisely. Let me see. I recollect
coming along Forty-second Street on my
way to the Manhattan. I&#39;d been dining at the
Lambs, and I stopped a minute on the sidewalk
under an L railway-track to light my pipe, when&mdash;yes,
it must have happened then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I expect you had been shadowed all day,&quot;
said Allerton. &quot;But I&#39;m forgetting my duties.
You are wanted on deck.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who wants me? Noddy Kinahan?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not much! He doesn&#39;t travel by his own
ships. It&#39;s the captain. I understand that you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
are to be presented to the company as a little
stowaway, and great surprise and pain will be officially
manifested at your appearance on board.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right. Come along and introduce me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Captain Kingdom&#39;s method of dealing with
stowaways&mdash;natural and artificial&mdash;was simple
and unvarying. On presentation, he first of all
abused them with all the resources of an almost
Esperantic vocabulary, and then handed them
over to Mr. Gates to be kicked into shape.</p>

<p class="indent">On Hughie Marrable&#39;s appearance on deck,
the captain proceeded with gusto to Part One of
his syllabus. Hard words break no bones, and
Hughie, who was breathing in great draughts of
sea-air and feeling less dizzy and more collected
each minute, set no particular store by the oratorical
display to which he was being treated. In
fact, he was almost guilty of the discourtesy of
allowing his attention to wander. He set the
crown upon his offence by interrupting the captain&#39;s
peroration.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look here, skipper,&quot; he said, brusquely
breaking in upon a period, &quot;you can drop that.
My name is Marrable. I am not a stowaway, and
I have been dumped on board this ship by order
of&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your name,&quot; said Captain Kingdom with
relish, &quot;is anything I choose to call you; and as
you stowed yourself away on board&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
&quot;Look here,&quot; said Hughie, &quot;I want a word
with you&mdash;in your own cabin for choice. All
right,&quot; he continued with rising voice, as the captain
broke out again, &quot;I&#39;ll have it here instead.
First of all, what is Mr. Noddy Kinahan paying
you for this job?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The captain turned to the mate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sock him, Mr. Gates!&quot; he roared.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Gates, whose curiosity&mdash;together with
that of the rest of the crew&mdash;had been roused, as
Hughie meant it to be, by the latter&#39;s reference
to Mr. Noddy Kinahan&#39;s share in the present
situation, moved forward to his task with less
alacrity than usual, and paused readily enough
when Hughie continued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you&#39;ll put back, captain, and land me anywhere
within a hundred miles of New York, I&#39;ll
give you double what Kinahan is paying you for
this job.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You <i>look</i> like a man with money, I must say!&quot;
replied Kingdom. &quot;Now then, Mr. Gates!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s to be no deal, then?&quot; said Hughie composedly.
&quot;Very well. The next question is, if
I am coming with you, how am I going to be
treated? Cabin or steer&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll show you,&quot; roared the incensed skipper.
&quot;Knock him silly, Mr. Gates!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Gates came on with a rush. But Hughie,
who all this time had been taking his bearings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
leapt back lightly in his bare feet and snatched
a capstan-bar from the rack behind him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Keep your distance for a moment, Mr. Gates,&quot;
he commanded, &quot;if you don&#39;t want your head
cracked. I haven&#39;t finished interviewing this
captain of yours yet. Happy to oblige <i>you</i> later,
for any period you care to specify.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Nother Percy!&quot; commented Mr. Dingle dejectedly,
expectorating over the side. He was
a plain man, was Mr. Dingle, and loved straight
hitting and words of one syllable.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Gates paused, and Hughie, leaning back
against the bulwarks and toying with the capstan-bar,
continued to address the fulminating
mariner on the bridge.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, captain, I&#39;m going to be brief with you&mdash;brief
and business-like. You&#39;ve been paid by
Kinahan to shanghai me and take me for a long
sea-voyage. Very good. I&#39;m not kicking. I
wanted to get to Europe anyhow, and I rather
like long sea-voyages, especially before the mast.
In fact, I&#39;d rather sail before the mast on board
this ship than in the cuddy. (Keep still, Mr.
Gates!) As I&#39;m here, I&#39;ve no particular objection
to working my passage, always reserving to
myself the right to make things hot for your employer
when I get ashore. I&#39;ll work as an A.B. or
deck-hand if you like, though personally I would
rather do something in the engine-room. I&#39;m
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
pretty well qualified in that direction. But I must
be decently treated, and there must be no more
sand-bagging or knockabout variety business. Is
it a deal?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Captain Kingdom surveyed the sinewy stowaway
before him thoughtfully. He saw that until
Hughie gave up the capstan-bar Mr. Gates
would have little chance of enforcing discipline.
He must temporise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can give you a job in the engine-room,&quot; he
said, in what he imagined was a more conciliatory
tone. &quot;Second engineer&#39;s down with something
this morning. You can take his watch.
Drop that capstan-bar of yours, and go and see
Mr. Angus, the chief.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That should suit me,&quot; replied Hughie. &quot;But
as a guarantee of good faith, and to avoid disappointing
the assembled company, I&#39;m quite willing
to stand up and have a turn with Mr. Gates
here, or that gentleman over by the funnel-stay,
or any one else you may appoint. But I should
<i>prefer</i> Mr. Gates,&quot; he added, almost affectionately.
&quot;I&#39;m not in first-class form at present,
as my head has got a dint in it behind; but I&#39;ll
do my best. Are you game, Mr. Gates?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go on, Mr. Gates, learn him!&quot; commanded
the highly gratified skipper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Drop that bar,&quot; shouted the genial Mr. Gates,
&quot;and I&#39;ll kill you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
&quot;Half a minute, please,&quot; said Hughie, as unruffled
as if he were putting on the gloves for a
ten-minute spar in a gymnasium. &quot;I&#39;m not going
to fight a man in sea-boots in my bare feet. Can
any gentleman oblige me with&mdash;Thank you, sir!
You are a white man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A pair of oily canvas tennis shoes, with list
soles, pattered down on the deck beside him.
Their donor, the &quot;white man,&quot;&mdash;a coal-black
individual attired chiefly in cotton-waste,&mdash;was
smiling affably from the engine-room hatchway.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They&#39;ll dae ye fine,&quot; he observed unexpectedly,
and disappeared below.</p>

<p class="indent">In a moment Hughie had slipped on the shoes.
Then, casting away the bar, he hurled himself
straight at the head of Mr. Gates.</p>

<p class="indent">In the brief but exhilarating exhibition which
followed Mr. Gates realised that a first mate on
the defensive is a very different being from a first
mate on the rampage. He had become so accustomed
to breaking in unresisting dock-rats and bemused
foreigners, taking his own time and using
his boots where necessary, that a high-pressure
combat with a man who seemed to be everywhere
except at the end of his fist&mdash;to his honour
he never once thought of employing his foot&mdash;was
an entire novelty to him. He fought sullenly
but ponderously, wasting his enormous
strength on murderous blows which never reached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
their mark, and stolidly enduring a storm of
smacks, bangs, and punches that would have
knocked a man of less enduring material into a
pulp. But there is one blow which no member
of the human family can stand up to, glutton
for punishment though he be. Hughie made a
sudden feint with his left at his opponent&#39;s body,
just below the heart. Gates dropped his guard,
momentarily throwing forward his head as he
did so. Instantaneously a terrific upper-cut from
Hughie&#39;s right took him squarely under the chin.
Mr. Gates described a graceful parabola, and
landed heavily on his back on deck, striking his
head against a ring-bolt as he fell. The whole
fight had lasted less than four minutes.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie was about to assist his fallen opponent
to rise, when he heard a warning cry from half-a-dozen
voices. He swung round, to find the
captain making for him, open-mouthed, with the
capstan-bar. He sprang lightly aside&mdash;a further
blessing on those list shoes!&mdash;and his opponent
charged past him, bringing down the bar with a
flail-like sweep upon the drum of a steam windlass.
Next moment Hughie, grasping the foremast
shrouds, leaped on the bulwarks and pulled
himself up to the level of the bridge, which was unoccupied
save by the man at the wheel, who had
been an enthusiastic spectator of the scene below.</p>

<p class="indent">Having climbed upon the bridge, and so secured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
the upper ground in case of any further attack,
Hughie leaned over the rails and parleyed.
In his hand he held a pair of heavy binoculars,
which he had taken out of a box clamped to the
back of the wind-screen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The first man who attempts to follow me up
here,&quot; he announced, when he had got his breath
back, &quot;will get this pair of glasses in the eye.
Captain, I don&#39;t think you are a great success
as an employer of labour. You haven&#39;t got the
knack of conciliating your men. Can&#39;t we come
to terms? Mine are very simple. I want some
clothes&mdash;my own, for choice. If you haven&#39;t
got them, anything quiet and unobtrusive will do.
But I decline to go about in orange-and-red
pyjama trousers in mid-Atlantic to please you or
anybody else. For one thing they&#39;re not warm,
and for another they&#39;re not usual. If you will
oblige me in this matter, I am quite willing to
live at peace with you. I don&#39;t see that you can
really suppress me except by killing me, and that
is a thing which I don&#39;t think you have either the
authority or the pluck to do. Why not give me a
billet in the engine-room and cry quits?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Captain Kingdom looked up at the obstreperous
mutineer on the bridge, and down at the recumbent
Mr. Gates on the deck, and ground his
teeth. Then he looked up to the bridge again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right,&quot; he growled. &quot;Come down!&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chVIII" id="chVIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="h3">A BENEFIT PERFORMANCE</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Hughie,</span> having been relieved to a slight extent
from sartorial humiliation, entered upon his
engine-room duties forthwith.</p>

<p class="indent">The society in which he found himself consisted
of Mr. Angus, the chief,&mdash;engineers, like gardeners,
editors, and Cabinet Ministers, are practically
all Scotsmen,&mdash;Mr. Goble, the acting-second
(<i>vice</i> Mr. Walsh, sick), and a motley gang
of undersized, half-mutinous, wholly vile sweepings
of humanity in the form of firemen. Mr.
Walsh was suffering from an intermittent form
of malaria contracted years ago in an up-river
trip to the pestilential regions round Saigon. Mr.
Angus, a hoary-headed and bottle-nosed Dundonian,
who could have charmed a scrap-heap
into activity, received Hughie with native politeness,
and paid him the compliment of working him
uncommonly hard. He explained (with perfect
truth) that the only reason why he was not at that
moment driving a Cunarder was a habit of his,
viewed by certain owners with regrettable narrowness
of vision, of &quot;takin&#39; a drap, whiles.&quot;
The concluding adverb Hughie correctly estimated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
to mean &quot;whenever I can get anything to
drink.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I canna see what for they should be sae partic&#39;lar
aboot it,&quot; mused Mr. Angus in recounting
the circumstance, &quot;for I haundle her jist as weel
drunk as sober. However, here I am, and there&#39;s
an end o&#39;t. Aiblins it&#39;s jist as weel. I could rin
the engines o&#39; ony Cunarder afloat, but I ken fine
there&#39;s not hauf-a-dozen men in their hale fleet
could knock eight knots oot o&#39; the auld Orinoco.
There&#39;s a kin&#39; o&#39; divinity aboot it, I doot. A man&#39;s
pit whaur he&#39;s maist wantit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John Alexander Goble, the acting-second,
proved to be a man of greater depth and more
surprises than his superior. He it was who had
thrown the list shoes to Hughie before the battle
with Mr. Gates, which showed that he was at
heart a Sportsman; he had taken the first opportunity
of asking for the return of the same, which
showed that he was a Scotsman; but he had found
Hughie a better pair of shoes in their stead, together
with some garments more suitable than
the blue jumper and the orange-and-red pyjama
trousers, which showed that he was a good Samaritan:
and a man who is a Sportsman and a
Scot and a good Samaritan all rolled into one is
an addition to the society of any engine-room.</p>

<p class="indent">His face wore an expression of chastened gloom;
and if washed and set ashore in his native Caledonia,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
he would probably have received a unanimous
invitation to come and glower over the
plate in the doorway of the nearest Wee Free
conventicle. His speech was slow and unctuous:
one could imagine him under happier circumstances
conducting family worship, and pausing
to elucidate in approved fashion some specially
obvious passage in the evening&#39;s &quot;portion,&quot; thus:
&quot;From the expression, &#39;a michty man o&#39; valour,&#39;
we may gather that the subject of this reference
was a person of considerable stature and undoubted
physical courage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was habitually and painfully sober, for
reasons which Hughie learned from him at a
period when they had more leisure to study each
other&#39;s characters. He was ignorant of the first
principles of mechanics, but could be trusted to
keep the Orinoco&#39;s propeller-shaft revolving at
a steady seventy-two to the minute; and he had
a gentle compelling way with refractory firemen
which made for sweet reasonableness and general
harmony below stairs, what time Mr. Angus
was recovering from one of those sudden and regrettable
attacks of indisposition which usually
coincided with the forgetfulness of the steward to
lock up the cabin whisky-bottle.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie berthed in the foc&#39;sle, and was regarded
by the Dagoes, Dutchmen, <i>et hoc genus omne</i>, with
mingled admiration for the manner in which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
had settled Mr. Gates, and mystified surprise that
a man capable of such a feat should be content to
live on his own rations and sleep in his allotted
bunk, without desiring to make researches into
the respective succulence and comfort of his
neighbours&#39;.</p>

<p class="indent">On the whole Hughie found his life tolerable
enough, as the Orinoco butted and grunted her
way across the Newfoundland Banks; and he
experienced no pang when the Apulia, spouting
smoke from her four funnels and carrying his
luggage in one of her state-rooms, swept past
them on the rim of the southern horizon on their
third day out. He was accustomed to rough
quarters, and any new experience of things as
they are was of interest to him. Moreover, he
possessed the priceless possession of a cast-iron
digestion; and a man so blessed can afford to snap
his fingers at most of the sundry and manifold
changes of this world.</p>

<p class="indent">Captain Kingdom and Mr. Gates for the time
being held him severely aloof. The taciturn Mr.
Dingle conveyed to him, by means of a surprisingly
ingenious code of grunts and expectorations,
that provided he, Hughie,&mdash;or Brown, as
he was usually called,&mdash;was content to go his
way without hunting for trouble, he, Mr. Dingle,
was content to go his without endeavouring to
supply it. Altogether there seemed to be no reason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
for doubting that the Orinoco, provided she
did not open up and sink like a basket <i>en route</i>,
would ultimately reach the port of Bordeaux,
bringing her sheaves, in the form of Hughie and
some unspeakable claret, with her.</p>

<p class="indent">But there is more than one way of making
money out of the shipping trade.</p>

<p class="indent">One night Hughie was leaning over the taffrail
behind the wheel-house at the stern. It was
two o&#39;clock, and the darkness was intensified by
a heavy mist. There was almost no wind, and
the Orinoco, like a draught-horse which feels the
wheels of its equipage upon a tram-line, slid
gratefully up and down the lazy rollers with the
nearest approach to comfort that she had experienced
that voyage.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie was idly watching the phosphorescent
wake of the propeller, wondering whether Captain
Kingdom had orders to land him in France in his
shirt and trousers or throw him overboard before
they got there, when a figure rose up out of the
darkness beside him. It was the easy-going Mr.
Allerton.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo, Percy!&quot; said Hughie. He had soon
dropped into the nomenclature of the foc&#39;sle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look here,&quot; said Allerton, in a more purposeful
voice than usual; &quot;come along and look
at this boat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The largest of the three boats carried by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
Orinoco lay close by them. She was swung inboard
and rested on deck-chocks below the davits.
A canvas cover, one end of which fluttered intermittently
in the breeze, roofed her over. Allerton
lifted this flap and inserted his hand. Presently
there was a splutter and a glimmer, and it
became plain that he was holding a lighted match
under the canvas.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look!&quot; he whispered.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie peered under the flap. He saw water-barrels,
a spirit-keg, and various bags and boxes.
Then the match went out, and Allerton withdrew
his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">The pair retired once more to their shelter behind
the wheel-house.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You saw that?&quot; said Allerton.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did. Do they usually keep the boats provisioned
on this ship? If so, I don&#39;t blame
them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not they. Somebody is going for a water-picnic
shortly&mdash;that&#39;s all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie mused.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Am <i>I</i> the man, do you think?&quot; he said at
length.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I don&#39;t think so. There&#39;s too much grub
for one. Besides the other boats are provisioned
too. It looks as if the ship were to be abandoned.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But why? There&#39;s no reason why she should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
drop to bits for a long time yet. Rust is very
binding, you know. Probably they keep her provisioned
just in case&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Allerton wagged his head sagaciously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s more in this than meets the eye,&quot;
he said. &quot;It is my pleasure and privilege, as you
know, to act as steward at present during the regretted
retirement of the regular holder of that
office, owing to eczema of the hands. (Even Mr.
Gates shies at eczema sea-pie!) Now there&#39;s some
mischief brewing in the cuddy, and they&#39;re all in
it&mdash;Kingdom, Gates, and Angus. I&#39;m not quite
sure about Dingle, because he berths forward;
but I think he is too. What&#39;s more: it&#39;s something
they can&#39;t afford to have given away. Kingdom,
who usually keeps Angus very short of drink at
sea, now lets him have it whenever he wants it,
and generally speaking is going out of his way
to keep him sweet. That shows he can&#39;t afford
to quarrel with him. And when a captain can&#39;t
afford to quarrel with a chief engineer whom he
hates, it usually means that he and the engineer
are in together over some hanky-panky which has
its roots in the engine-room. You mark my words,
one of these fine nights that hoary-headed old
Caledonian will open a sea-cock or two and rush
up on deck and say the ship is sinking. It&#39;ll be
a case of all hands to the boats; the Orinoco will
go to her long-overdue and thoroughly deserved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
rest at the bottom, and the insurance people will
pay up and look pleasant.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;H&#39;m,&quot; said Hughie; &quot;there seems to be something
 in what you say. I wish I could keep an
eye on the old sinner in the engine-room; but
since Walsh came back to duty I&#39;ve no excuse for
going there at all now. It might almost be worth
while to warn Goble. He&#39;s a decent chap.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is on duty in the engine-room now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Walsh, I should think. Angus usually makes
way for him about eight bells. But I&#39;m not sure.
Hark! Do you notice anything about the beat
of the engines?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not being an expert, can&#39;t say I do. They
sound a trifle more asthmatic than usual, perhaps.
What&#39;s up?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Somebody has got the donkey-pump at work,&quot;
said Hughie. &quot;It may be Angus, after all, monkeying
with the water-ballast. Hallo!&quot; He leaned
over the stern-rail and peered down. &quot;Do you
notice anything unusual about the propeller?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It seems to be kicking up a bit of a dust,&quot; said
Allerton. &quot;Is it going round faster, or getting
nearer the surface?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s half out of the water,&quot; said Hughie.
&quot;That means that the old man has pumped out
the after double-bottom tank. Look, we&#39;re all
down by the head!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The two stepped out from behind the wheelhouse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
and gazed forward. The flush deck of the
Orinoco was undoubtedly running downhill
towards the bows.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s the game?&quot; inquired Allerton excitedly.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie was thinking. Presently he said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not sure, but his next move should tell
us. Either he is trying to drive her nose under
and sink her by manipulating the water-ballast,
which seems a hopeless job in a flat calm like
this, and suicidal if it comes off; or else he is
working up for a scare of some kind, which will
frighten the crew into&mdash;Hallo? what&#39;s that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a warning cry from Mr. Dingle, who
was standing right forward in the bows.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Something right ahead, sir! Looks like&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was an answering shout from the bridge,
where the captain was standing by the wheel,
followed by a jangling of telegraph-bells. Next
moment the Orinoco gave a jar and a stagger,
and Hughie and Allerton pitched forward on to
their noses.</p>

<p class="indent">There were shouts and cries all over the ship,
and men came tumbling up the hatchways.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ve struck something,&quot; gasped Allerton.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Struck your grandmother!&quot; grunted Hughie,
who was sitting up rubbing his nose tenderly.
&quot;That jar came from directly underneath us.
It was caused by Angus reversing his engines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
without giving the ship time to slow down. I
daresay he never even shut off steam. Likely
enough he&#39;s lifted the engines off their beds. Well,
perhaps he had finished with them anyway. Come
along forward.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">By this time a frightened crowd had assembled
on the deck of the Orinoco, which, lying motionless
on the silent sea, artistically tilted up by the
stern,&mdash;Hughie began to grasp the inwardness of
Mr. Angus&#39;s man&oelig;uvres with the water-ballast,&mdash;presented
a sufficiently alarming appearance
even on that calm night.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Dingle and the captain, the one hanging
over the bows and the other standing in an attitude
of alertness on the bridge, were sustaining
between them a conversation which vaguely
suggested to Hughie a carefully rehearsed &quot;cross-talk&quot;
duologue between two knockabout artistes
of the Variety firmament&mdash;say the Brothers
Bimbo in one of their renowned impromptu
&quot;patter scenes.&quot; The resemblance was enhanced
by the fact that the &quot;patter&quot; was delivered <i>fortissimo</i>
by both performers, and each repeated
the other&#39;s most telling phrases in tones which
made it impossible for the audience to avoid hearing
them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What was it?&quot; shouted Bimbo Senior (as
represented by Captain Kingdom).</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lump of wreckage!&quot; roared Bimbo Junior,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
from a prolonged scrutiny of the ship&#39;s forefoot.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lump of wreckage?&quot; bellowed Bimbo Senior.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lump of wreckage!&quot; corroborated Bimbo
Junior.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course it <i>might</i> have been ice,&quot; suggested
Number One, at the top of his voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Might have been ice,&quot; replied the conscientious
echo.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pairsonally I&#39;m inclined tae believe it was jist
a wee bit coral island,&quot; interpolated a third voice,
with painful and stunning distinctness. The Chief
Engineer had suddenly made his appearance on
the bridge.</p>

<p class="indent">The captain was obviously much put out. In
the first place, coral islands are not plentiful in
the North Atlantic, and there are limits even to
the gullibility of an audience composed of foreign
deck-hands and half-civilised firemen. Secondly,
the axiom that two is company and three none
applies even to cross-talk duologues. Thirdly,
Mr. Angus was excessively drunk, and consequently
the laboriously planned comedietta at
present in progress might, owing to his inartistic
and uncalled-for intrusion upon the scene, take
a totally unrehearsed turn at any moment.</p>

<p class="indent">The captain lost no time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What report have you from the engine-room,
Mr. Angus?&quot; he inquired loudly and pointedly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
Mr. Angus, suddenly recognising his cue, and
realising almost with tears that he had been imperilling
the success of the entire piece by unseemly
&quot;gagging,&quot; pulled himself together, returned
to his text, and announced that the ship
was badly down by the head and the stokehold
awash.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s nothing else for it,&quot; yelled the captain
resignedly, &quot;but to leave her. Clear away the
boats, Mr. Gates!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Having thus established a good working explanation
of the disaster, and incidentally enlisted
the entire audience&mdash;those members of it, that
is, who were not already doing service in the
<i>claque</i>&mdash;as unbiassed witnesses for the defence
in case the insurance company turned nasty, the
intrepid commander descended from the bridge
to his cabin, to collect a few necessaries pending
the abandonment of his beloved vessel.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie and Allerton surveyed each other.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Which boat are you going in?&quot; inquired
Allerton.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;None,&quot; said Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Going to stay on board?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But she&#39;ll sink under our feet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t believe she&#39;s as badly damaged as all
that. There&#39;s some game on here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t suppose she&#39;s damaged at all,&quot; said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
Allerton, &quot;but you can be sure they won&#39;t be such
blamed fools as to leave the ship floating about
to be picked up. Old Angus will let water into
her before he leaves, if he hasn&#39;t started the process
already.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I&#39;m not going in any of those boats,&quot;
said Hughie. &quot;If the Orinoco sinks, I&#39;ll float to
Europe on a hen-coop.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May I have half of it?&quot; said Allerton.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You may,&quot; said Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">And so the S. S. Orinoco Salvage Company,
Limited, was floated, and the Board of Directors
entered upon their new duties at once.</p>

<p class="indent">By this time the boats had been swung outboard
and their provisioning completed. They
were now lowered from the davits, and the men
began to take their places. There was no panic,
for the night was calm, and the Orinoco showed
no signs of settling deeper. Messrs. Gates and
Dingle were already at their respective tillers.
Captain Kingdom and Mr. Angus were standing
by the davits to which the whale-boat was still
shackled. Mr. Goble, apparently in no hurry, was
leaning over the bulwarks in the darkness not far
from Hughie and Allerton, dispassionately regarding
the crew&#39;s preparations for departure. He
approached nearer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s a wheen fowk in thae boats,&quot; he observed.
&quot;I doot we&#39;d be safer on board.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
Hughie turned to him and nodded comprehendingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s my opinion too,&quot; he said, &quot;and Percy&#39;s.
We&#39;re thinking of staying here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Goble regarded him reflectively.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that a fact?&quot; he said. &quot;Weel, I&#39;ll bide too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And so a third member was co-opted on to the
Board of Directors.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;d better get out of sight,&quot; said Hughie.
&quot;They won&#39;t like leaving us behind. I think I
know a good place to wait. Come along.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The trio slipped round behind the chart-house,
passed along a deserted stretch of the deck, and
disappeared down the engine-room hatchway.</p>

<p class="indent">The engine-room was illuminated by a couple
of swinging lanterns. A black and greasy flood
of water glistened on the iron floor below, filling
the crank-pits and covering the propeller-shaft.
The doors leading to the stokehold were standing
open, and they could see that the floors there too
were flooded, though the water had not reached
the level of the fire-bars. Owing to the immobility
of the ship, its oily surface was almost unruffled,
and the engine-room itself was curiously
quiet after the turmoil on deck. The fires were
burning low, but occasionally a glowing clinker
slipped from between the bars into the blood-red
flood beneath, with a sizzling splash. The steam
was hissing discontentedly in the gauges.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
The Salvage Board stood knee-deep in the
water of the engine-room.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie picked up a smoky inspection-lamp,&mdash;a
teapot-like affair with a wick in the spout,&mdash;lit
it, and peered about.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now look here,&quot; he said, &quot;I don&#39;t quite know
where this water came from, and it doesn&#39;t much
matter, as no more is coming in at present. If
the old man means to sink the ship he will have
to come down here to do it. He has probably
got some dodge arranged by which he can just
turn a wheel and open a valve and send her to
the bottom. Isn&#39;t that the idea, Goble? (I&#39;ll
explain to you afterwards, Allerton.) My impression
is that he&#39;ll pop down and turn the valve on
just before he leaves. In that case one of us
must stand by and turn it off again. You two
go through into the stokehold. He&#39;s not likely
to come in there. If he does, you must use your
own discretion. I&#39;ll wait here, on the far side of
the cylinders, up against the condenser. He&#39;s not
likely to see me, but I shall be able to watch him
and see which valve-wheel he turns on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The other two obeyed, and Hughie, scrambling
across the bed-plates of the engines, ensconced
himself behind a convenient cross-head, with his
feet in a flooded crank-pit and his body squeezed
back as far as possible into the shadow of the
condenser.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
He had not long to wait. Presently cautious
feet were heard descending the iron ladder, and
Mr. Angus, comparatively sober, stepped heavily
into the flood on the floor.</p>

<p class="indent">His first proceeding was to wade to the stokehold
end of the engine-room,&mdash;Hughie thought
at first that he was going right through into the
arms of Allerton and Goble, and wondered what
they would do with him,&mdash;where he began to
manipulate the great valve-wheel which kept the
steam imprisoned in the boilers; and presently
Hughie could hear the roar of the escape far
above his head. This was a purely precautionary
measure, and could do no harm to any one.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Mr. Angus splashed his way to the corner
by the donkey-pump, where the machinery for
controlling the bilge and water-ballast valves was
situated, and began to twist over another wheel.
Presently there was a gurgling bubbling sound
in the bowels of the ship, followed by a slight
hissing and whispering on the surface of the
water on the engine-room floor. The valve was
open.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Angus turned and lurched heavily through
the rising flood to the iron ladder. Thirty seconds
later a glistening figure crawled out of the crank-pit
and vigorously turned the wheel in the opposite
direction. The gurgling and hissing ceased.
The valve was closed.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chIX" id="chIX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>LITERA SCRIPTA MANET</i></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Mr. Marrable</span>, did ever ye see a drookit
craw?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, see me!&quot; announced Mr. Goble complacently.</p>

<p class="indent">He crawled out of the engine-room companionway
and sat down on the deck. Excessive spruceness
had never been a foible of his, but now he
was an unrecognisable mass of coal-dust, oil, and
rust. He was dripping wet, for he had spent
the last hour in an exhaustive examination of the
Orinoco&#39;s waterlogged internal economy. The
morning sun was warm, and he steamed comfortably
as he detailed the result of his investigations
to Hughie, who in some imperceptible but inevitable
manner had taken command of the tiny
ship&#39;s company.</p>

<p class="indent">Shorn of technicalities and irrelevant excursions
into the regions of pawky philosophy, Mr.
Goble&#39;s report came to this.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Angus had pumped out the after ballast-tank
during the night, allowing the water, by
means of a specially rigged return-pipe, to flow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
into the bilges of the ship instead of escaping
overboard. By this device he had altered the
Orinoco&#39;s centre of gravity in such a manner as
to produce the afore-mentioned down-hill slant
of her decks&mdash;a corroborative detail, as Pooh-Bah
would have observed, which gave a little
much-needed artistic verisimilitude to the Bimbo
Brothers&#39; bald and unconvincing narrative of disaster.
Incidentally he had flooded the forehold
and engine-room with sufficient water to give
those members of the ship&#39;s company who were
not in their employer&#39;s confidence the impression
that she was sinking, and to furnish those who
were with a <i>prima facie</i> argument for deserting
her.</p>

<p class="indent">But these thoughtful precautions, though sufficient
to procure the abandonment of the Orinoco,
were by no means sufficient to send her to the
bottom, a consummation to be achieved at any
cost; for to leave your ship lying about in mid-ocean,
to be picked up by the first chance-comer,
while you go hurrying home to extract a cheque
from the insurance company, savours of slipshod
business methods; and Mr. Noddy Kinahan was
nothing if not thorough.</p>

<p class="indent">Now every steamer which plies under Lloyds&#39;
ægis is fitted, below the water-line, with a set of
what are called bilge-valves. Through these it
is possible to expel any water which may have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
found its way into the body of the vessel. As it
is even more desirable to prevent the entrance of
water into your ship than to assist its exit, these
valves are of a strictly &quot;non-return&quot; variety,
and no amount of pressure from the outside
should ever prevail upon them to play the part of
Facing-Both-Ways. The very life of the ship
depends upon them; and the enterprising individual
who tampers with their mechanism in such
a manner as to convert what is meant to be an
Emergency Exit into a sort of Early Door for
the rolling deep, does so at the risk of coming
into immediate and painful collision with the
criminal laws of his country.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Angus, it appeared, had been employing
some of his spare time during the voyage in reversing
one of these bilge-valves, with such skill
and <i>finesse</i> that, as we have seen, one had only
to give a turn to a worm-and-wheel gear in the
engine-room to admit the Atlantic Ocean in large
quantities.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, he has a heid on him, has Angus!&quot; commented
Mr. Goble with professional appreciation,
&quot;even when he&#39;s fou&#39;. He made a rare job o&#39;t.
But how he managed to contrive that imitation
o&#39; a collision, merely through some jookery-packery
wi&#39; the reverse-gear and throttle, wi&#39;oot tearin&#39;
the guts oot o&#39; her, I div not ken. Man, it was
a fair conjurin&#39; trick! By rights the link motion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
should be twisted intil a watch-chain and the
cross-heids jammit in the guides. But they&#39;re
no. It&#39;s jist Providence, I doot,&quot; he added rather
apologetically, with the air of one who should
have thought of this sooner.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he uprose from his seat on an inverted
bucket.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Before I gang ben, sir,&quot; he concluded, &quot;tae
change ma feet and ma breeks, I&#39;ll tak&#39; the liberty
tae inquire of you what you propose tae dae next.
Maircy me! Yon&#39;s Walsh.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Two figures had appeared round the corner of
the chart-house, their presence on the far side
thereof having been advertised for some time by
the clanking of the deck-pumps. (Mr. Angus&#39;s
precaution of blowing off steam before leaving
had put mechanical assistance in getting rid of
the water out of the question for the time being.)</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, it&#39;s me,&quot; said Walsh, who, it will be remembered,
was the second engineer, to whom
Hughie had recently been acting as deputy. &quot;I
should have come on duty at eight bells to relieve
Angus, but I slept right through everything
till Mr. Marrable found me in my bunk an hour
or two ago. I expect they put something in my
grog last night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s quite a hobby of theirs,&quot; said Allerton
drily. &quot;Mr. Marrable, I have found something
that may be useful to us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
He handed his superior officer a damp but undamaged
little packet of papers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where did you find them?&quot; asked Hughie.
&quot;I thought I had gone through Kingdom&#39;s kit
pretty thoroughly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They were sticking in the falls of the davits
belonging to the boat Kingdom went off in,&quot; replied
Allerton. &quot;I saw him hurrying along the
deck from his cabin just before his departure,
carrying the log-book and some papers and instruments.
I expect he dropped these as he went
over the side.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sit down, everybody,&quot; said the commander,
&quot;we&#39;ll see this through. It may concern us all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The packet contained two letters, together with
some invoices and bills of lading referring chiefly
to the Orinoco&#39;s cargo of astringent claret.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie glanced through the letters. Then he
re-read them with some deliberation. Then he
whistled low and expressively. Then he sat up
and sighed, gently and contentedly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Noddy Kinahan,&quot; he said, &quot;is shortly
going to wish, with all his benevolent and philanthropic
little heart, that he had never been born.
And we are the people that are going to make him
wish. Listen!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He read the two letters aloud. They were brief,
but explicit. One contained Kinahan&#39;s orders to
Kingdom as to the disposal of the Orinoco. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
other was a sort of invoice, or consignment note,
relating to the person of one Marrable, who had
apparently been shipped on board the night before
the ship sailed. Each of these documents, it may
be added, contained sufficient matter to ensure
penal servitude for their author.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie stopped reading, and there was a long
and appreciative silence. Then Allerton said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What beats me is to understand how Kinahan
could have been such a mug as to commit these
schemes to paper, and how Kingdom should have
been such a fool as to want to keep them. <i>I&#39;d</i>
have let them go down in the Orinoco.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I expect one explanation covers both cases,&quot;
said Hughie. &quot;Kingdom probably demanded his
orders in black and white, as a guarantee that he
would get his money when he had done his job.
Otherwise he had no claim on Kinahan for a
penny, beyond his ordinary wage as skipper.
Kinahan probably agreed, stipulating that the
letters should be handed back to him when they
squared accounts. It was a risky thing to do, but
when two thieves can&#39;t trust each other, and go
dropping about documentary evidence to that
effect&mdash;well, that&#39;s where poor but deserving
people like ourselves come in. No, I shouldn&#39;t
think Kingdom <i>would</i> want to leave these behind;
and I opine that he&#39;s a pretty sick man by this
time if he has missed them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
He folded the letters up, and put them away
carefully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, gentlemen,&quot; he said briskly, &quot;I propose
that we go below and see if there is sufficient
steam on the Orinoco to pump the rest of the
water out of her and get the propeller revolving
again. We&#39;ll have to damp down most of the
fires, because we can&#39;t run too many firemen, but
I think we ought to knock four or five knots out
of her in ordinary weather. Luckily, seventy-five
<i>per cent</i> of the ship&#39;s company are competent
engineers. After that we&#39;ll have some breakfast,
and after that we&#39;ll make tracks for home. We&#39;ll
work&quot;&mdash;he smacked his lips cheerily, like an
energetic pedagogue on the first morning of term&mdash;&quot;in
shifts of three. Two men will run the
engine-room and stokehold, and the third will
take the wheel. The fourth can sleep. That will
give us each eighteen hours on and six hours off.
I don&#39;t know where we are, and I have no means
of finding out, as Captain Kingdom has walked
off with the chart and most of the proper instruments.
But we must be near land, or they would
not have taken to the boats yet. If we keep steaming
steadily east (with a little north in it), at about
a hundred miles a day,&mdash;which I fancy is about
our limit,&mdash;we should knock up against something
sooner or later. And when we do, we&#39;ll get
hold of the proper authorities, and I venture to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
think that with the help of these two letters and
that doctored bilge-valve down below we shall be
able to prepare a welcome for those three boat-loads
of shipwrecked mariners, when they arrive,
that will surprise them. Also, I fancy there will
be pickings for you in the way of salvage. What
a game!&quot; Hughie stood up, and inhaled a great
breath. This was real life! &quot;Are you <i>on</i>, boys?&quot;
he cried suddenly. &quot;Is the old Orinoco going to
the bottom this journey?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The crew rose at him and gave three cheers.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Later that afternoon, as the Orinoco pounded
along at a strictly processional pace through the
ruffling waters,&mdash;the glass was falling and a
breeze getting up,&mdash;Deputy-Quartermaster
Lionel Hinchcliffe Welford-Welford Allerton,
late scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge, sometime
Assistant Deck-Hand in the mercantile
marine, descried from his post on the bridge a
small moving object upon the starboard bow.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the Orinoco&#39;s whale-boat, which was
proceeding under two lugsails on a course parallel
with the steamer&#39;s.</p>

<p class="indent">Allerton, who in the excitement of salving the
Orinoco had almost forgotten the existence of the
gang of buccaneers who had scuttled her, excitedly
rang the telegraph bell and summoned the rest of
the ship&#39;s company to his side.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
The emotions, however, aroused in the Orinoco
by the sight of the whale-boat were mild in comparison
with those excited in the undutiful whale-boat
by the spectacle of her resuscitated parent.
Mr. Angus, on beholding the steamer, kept discreetly
silent. He had given himself away by
seeing things which were not there once or twice
in his life before. But Captain Kingdom turned
a delicate apple-green.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look there!&quot; he gasped, pointing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yon bit cloud, ye mean?&quot; said the cautious
Angus.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no, man&mdash;the Orinoco!&quot; cried the
frantic skipper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh&mdash;the shup! Aye, aye!&quot; replied Mr.
Angus, rather pleased than otherwise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s a crew on board her,&quot; continued
Kingdom shakily. &quot;And she&#39;s got steam on her,
too!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aye,&quot; said Mr. Angus. &quot;I doot somebody will
have closed yon sea-cock again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who can it be?&quot; demanded the captain feverishly.
&quot;Surely we left no one on board. I told
Dingle to take that fellow Marrable in his boat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps,&quot; suggested Mr. Angus, &quot;yin of the
other boats cam&#39; back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kingdom pointed impatiently to two small
specks upon the horizon.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They&#39;re there,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
&quot;Maybe some liner has come across her and
left a bit crew on board her,&quot; continued the fertile
Mr. Angus.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If so, we&#39;d have seen the liner,&quot; replied Kingdom
irritably.</p>

<p class="indent">He took up his binoculars and began to scrutinise
the Orinoco, which had altered her course a
few points in their direction.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Angus had a fresh inspiration.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did ye mind tae wauken Walsh?&quot; he whispered.
&quot;If not, ye ken he micht weel&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The captain lowered his glasses, and nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He might be one,&quot; he agreed; &quot;but there are
four men on deck.&quot; He raised his binoculars
again. &quot;Yes, there they are. Well, whoever they
are and whatever the game is, we must get on
board again and do the job properly this time.&mdash;Hallo,
one of them is running below!&mdash;Here
he is again!&mdash;He&#39;s carrying something&mdash;flags,
I reckon. They&#39;re going to signal us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was right. Up to the topmost summit of
the Orinoco&#39;s grimy foremast travelled a signal&mdash;a
banner with a strange device indeed, but
conveying a perfectly intelligible message for all
that. It consisted of the nether or unmentionable
portion of a ragged suit of orange-and-red
striped pyjamas.</p>

<p class="indent">Having reached its destination, it inflated itself
in the freshening breeze and streamed out, defiant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
and derisive, in the rays of the setting sun;
flinging to the fermenting couple in the whale-boat
the simple but comprehensive intimation&mdash;&quot;Sold!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then, with one single joyous toot from her
siren, the Orinoco altered her course a couple of
points and wallowed off in a north-easterly direction,
leaving the crew of the whale-boat to listen
in admiring silence to a sulphurous antistrophe
in two dialects proceeding from the stern-sheets.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chX" id="chX"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="h3">THE END OF AN ODYSSEY</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Hughie</span> reckoned that they might have to
steam eastward for quite three or four days before
they sighted land.</p>

<p class="indent">This was an underestimate.</p>

<p class="indent">The history of the Orinoco&#39;s last voyage will
never be written. In the first place, those who
took part in it were none of them men who were
addicted to the composition of travellers&#39; tales;
and in the second, their recollections of the course
of events when all was over, were hopelessly
and rather mercifully blurred. Not that they
minded. One derives no pleasure or profit from
reconstructing a nightmare&mdash;especially when it
has lasted for sixteen days and nights.</p>

<p class="indent">Some events, of course, were focussed more
sharply in their memories than others. There
was that eternity of thirty-six hours during which
the Orinoco, with every vulnerable orifice sealed
up or battened down, her asthmatic engines pulsing
just vigorously enough to keep her head before
the wind, rode out a north-easterly gale
which blew her many miles out of her reckoning.
(&quot;Not that that matters much,&quot; said her philosophic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
commander. &quot;We don&#39;t know where we
are now, it&#39;s true; but then we didn&#39;t know where
we were before, so what&#39;s the odds? We&#39;ll keep
on steering away about north-east, and as we are
aiming at a target eight hundred miles wide we
ought to hit it somewhere.&quot;) Then there was a
palpitating night when the faithful engines, having
wheezily but unceasingly performed their
allotted task for a period long enough to lull all
who depended upon them into an optimistic frame
of mind, broke down utterly and absolutely; and
the fires had to be banked and the Orinoco allowed
to wallow unrestrainedly in the trough of
the sea while the entire ship&#39;s company, with
cracking muscles and heart-breaking gasps, released
a jammed crosshead from the guides and
took down a leaky cylinder.</p>

<p class="indent">They were evidently out of the ordinary sea-lanes,
for they sighted only one steamer in ten
days, and her they allowed to go by.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;None of us understand proper signalling,&quot;
said Hughie, &quot;so we can&#39;t attract her attention
without doing something absurdly theatrical,
like running up the ensign upside down; and
I&#39;m hanged if we&#39;ll do that&mdash;yet. After all, we
only want to know where we <i>are</i>. We may be
just off the coast of Ireland for all I can say, and
it does seem feeble to bring a liner out of her
course to ask her footling questions. It would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
be like stopping the Flying Scotsman to get a
light for one&#39;s pipe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Or asking a policeman in Piccadilly Circus
the nearest way to the Criterion bar,&quot; added
Allerton. &quot;I&#39;m with you all the time, captain.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And so these four mendicants allowed a potential
Good Samaritan to pass by and sink behind
the horizon. It was an action typical of their
race: they had no particular objection to death,
but they drew the line at being smiled at. Still,
there were moments during the next ten days
when they rather regretted their diffidence.</p>

<p class="indent">But events like these were mere excrescences
in a plane of dead monotony. The day&#39;s work
was made up of endless hours in a Gehenna-like
stokehold, where with aching backs and bleeding
hands they laboured to feed the insatiable fires,
or crawled along tunnel-like bunkers in search
of the gradually receding coal; spells at the wheel&mdash;sometimes
lashed to it&mdash;in biting wind or
blinding fog; the whole sustained on a diet of
ship&#39;s biscuit, salt pork, and lukewarm coffee,
tempered by brief but merciful intervals of the
slumber of utter exhaustion.</p>

<p class="indent">Still, one can get used to anything. They even
enjoyed themselves after a fashion. High endeavour
counts for something, whether you have
a wife and family dependent upon you, like Walsh,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
or can extract <i>la joie de vivre</i> out of an eighteen-hour
day and a workhouse diet, like Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">And they got to know each other, thoroughly,&mdash;a
privilege denied to most in these days of
restless activity and multifarious acquaintance.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a lasting wonder to Hughie how Allerton
could ever have fallen to his present estate; for
he displayed an amount of energy, endurance,
and initiative during this manhood-testing voyage
that was amazing. He himself ascribed his virtue
to want of opportunity to practise anything else,
but this was obviously too modest an explanation.
Perhaps blood always tells. At any rate, Allerton
took unquestioned rank as second in command
over the heads of two men whose technical knowledge
and physical strength far exceeded his own.
But in his hours of ease&mdash;few enough now&mdash;he
was as easy-going and flippant and casual as
ever.</p>

<p class="indent">Walsh in a sense was the weakest of the quartet.
He was a capable engineer and an honest
man, but he lacked the devil-may-care nonchalance
of the other three; for he had a wife
and eight children waiting for him in distant
Limehouse, and a fact like that gives a man a
distaste for adventure. He was a disappointed
man, too. He had held a chief engineer&#39;s &quot;ticket&quot;
for seven years, but he had never held a chief
engineer&#39;s billet. He could never afford to knock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
off work and wait until the right berth should
come his way: he must always take the first that
offered, for fear that the tale of boots and bread
in Limehouse should diminish. As a crowning
stroke of ill-luck, he had been paid off from his
last job because his ship had collided with a New
York lighter and been compelled to go into dry
dock for three months; and by shipping in the
Orinoco he was barely doing more than work
his passage home. His ten-year-old dream of
delivering Mrs. Walsh from her wash-tub for all
time, and exalting her from the <i>res angustæ</i> of
Teak Street, Limehouse, to a social environment
reserved exclusively for the wives of chief engineers,
seemed as far from fulfilment as ever.
Still, he maintained a stiff upper lip and kept his
watch like a man, which is more than most of us
would have done under the circumstances.</p>

<p class="indent">But it was Goble who interested Hughie most.
In the long night-watches, as they swung the
heavy fire-shovels in the stokehold, or heaved
the ever-accumulating clinkers over the side, or
took turn and turn about to gulp tepid water
out of a sooty bucket, or met over a collation of
coffee and ship&#39;s biscuit&mdash;the supper of one and
the breakfast of the other&mdash;in the galley, Goble
would let fall dry pawky reflections on life in
general, with autobiographical illustrations, which
enabled Hughie to piece together a fairly comprehensive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
idea of his companion&#39;s previous existence.</p>

<p class="indent">John Alexander Goble had played many parts
in his time, like most vagrants. He had been
born a gamekeeper&#39;s son in Renfrewshire, and
had lost his father early, that devoted upholder
of proprietary rights having been shot through
the head in a poaching affray. After this catastrophe
the widow, who had openly pined for
her native Glasgow during the whole of her husband&#39;s
lifetime, had returned to that municipal
paradise; and the ripening youth of John Alexander
Goble had been passed in a delectable
locality, known as &quot;The Coocaddens,&quot; to which
he could never refer without a gleam of tender
reminiscence in his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">Why John Alexander had ever deserted this
Eden Hughie could never rightly ascertain. His
references to that particular epoch in his career
were invariably obscure; but since he darkly
observed on one occasion that &quot;weemen can mak&#39;
a gowk o&#39; the best man leevin&#39;,&quot; Hughie gathered
that Mr. Goble&#39;s present course of life owed its
origin to a tender but unsatisfactory episode in
the dim and distant days of his hot youth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;After that,&quot; John would continue elliptically,
&quot;I went tae Motherwell. D&#39;ye ken Motherwell?
A grand place! Miles and miles of blast-furnaces,
and the sky lit up day and nicht, like the Last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
Judgment. I did a wheen odd jobs there. Whiles
I would hurl a trolley wi&#39; coke, whiles I would
sort coal wi&#39; some lassies, and at last I got a job
as a moulder.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; inquired the ever-receptive
Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What else but a body that makes moulds?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, but how does he do it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Weel, there&#39;s a sort o&#39; sandy place at the fit o&#39;
each smelting-furnace&mdash;like a bit sea-shore, ye&#39;ll
understand&mdash;and every four-and-twenty hours
they cast the furnace. They let oot the melted
ore, that is, and it rins doon intil moulds that hae
been made in the sand. (Ye dae it by just buryin&#39;
baulks o&#39; timber in rows and then pickin&#39; them oot
again, and the stuff rins intil the hollows that have
been left. When it&#39;s cauld they ca&#39; it pig-iron.)
Well, I stuck tae that job for a matter o&#39; sax
months. But it was drouthy work, besides bein&#39;
haird on the feet,&mdash;you go scratch-scratching in
the sand wi&#39; your bare soles makin&#39; the moulds,&mdash;and
presently I gave it up and took tae daen&#39; odd
jobs among the trucks and engines in the yairds.
I liked that fine, for machinery is the yin thing
that really excites me. First I was a coupler, then
I was a fireman, then I got tae drivin&#39; a wee
shunting engine, dunting trucks about the yaird.
And at last I was set in charge o&#39; a winding-engine
at a pit-heid. That was a grand job; but it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
didna last long. I was drinkin&#39; haird by this time&mdash;I&#39;d
stairtit after I left the Coocaddens&mdash;and
yin&#39; day I was that fou&#39; I let the cage gang doon
wi&#39; a run tae the bottom o&#39; the shaft.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was there anybody in the cage?&quot; inquired
Hughie, as Goble paused, as if to contemplate
some mental picture.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There was not, thank God! But there <i>was</i> a
bit laddie doon ablow in the pit, that was sittin&#39; on
his hutch&mdash;his truck, that is&mdash;at the fit o&#39; the
shaft, waitin&#39; on the cage. He wasna expectin&#39; the
thing tae fall doon like a daud o&#39; putty, so he was
no&#39; sittin&#39; quite clear; and the cage cam&#39; doon and
took off baith his feet. Man, I hae never forgotten
his mither&#39;s face when they brought him up.
I lost ma job, and I hae never touched a drop
since. For seven-and-twenty years have I been
on the teetotal&mdash;seven-and-twenty years! It&#39;ll
shorten ma life, I doot,&quot; he added gloomily; &quot;but
I&#39;ll bide by it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What became of the boy?&quot; inquired Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s gotten twa wooden feet the noo,&quot; replied
Goble more cheerfully, &quot;and he&#39;s been
minding the lamp-room this twenty year. I&#39;ve
heard frae him noo and again, and we&#39;ve always
been freens; but his auld mither has never forgiven
me. She&#39;s ower seventy the day, but Jeems
tells me she aye lets a curse every time he mentions
ma name.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
A further instalment of Mr. Goble&#39;s adventures
explained how he took to the sea.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;After I cleared oot o&#39; Motherwell I went to
the Clydeside. I was a fair enough mechanic by
this time, but I had tak&#39;n a sort o&#39; skunner at
machinery&mdash;no wi&#39;oot some reason&mdash;and I tried
for to get taken on as a dock-hand. I had no luck
there, and I was fair starvin&#39; when yin day I met
a freend o&#39; min&#39; on the Dumbarton Road, and he
asked me would I like tae wash dishes and peel
potaties on a passenger steamer. I would hae
been pleased tae soop the lums o&#39; muckle Hell
by that time, gin it was for a wage, I was that
thrawn wi&#39; hunger; so I jist said, &#39;&#39;Deed ay!&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For a hale summer I sat peelin&#39; potaties and
washin&#39; dishes on board the Electra, her that has
done a trip doon the watter, roond about Arran
and Bute, and hame by Skelmorlie ilka day o&#39; the
summer season for twenty-twa years. When the
winter cam&#39; on I dooted I would be oot o&#39; a job
again; but bein&#39; nowadays permanently on the
teetotal, and varra dependable, I was shifted
tae the auld Stornoway, o&#39; the same line, carryin&#39;
goods, cattle, and passengers tae the West Highlands&mdash;Coll,
Tiree, Barra, Uist, Ullapool, and
a wheen places in and oot o&#39; sea-lochs up and doon
that coast. She loused frae the Broomielaw every
Thursday at three o&#39;clock in the afternoon, and
she was back there, week in week out, summer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
and winter, by eleven in the forenoon o&#39; the following
Wednesday. The folk along by Largs, where
her cap&#39;n lived, used tae set their watches by her.
She was a fine auld boat, the Stornoway: she piled
herself up on the rocks below the Scuir of Eig,
where she had no call tae be, in a snowstorm seven
winters syne. I was a cabin steward nowadays,
ye&#39;ll unnerstand; and once we were roond the Mull
and the passengers had thrawn up what they&#39;d
had tae their tea off Gourock and tak&#39;n a dander
ashore at Oban, appetites was big and I was busy.
It was the first time I had seen the gentry at their
meals, and it improved my mainners considerable.
Never since then have I skailed ma tea intil ma
saucer: I jist gie a bit blow on it noo. Yon&#39;s Mr.
Allerton roarin&#39; for to be relieved at the wheel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On another occasion Goble explained how he
came to forsake the fleshpots of the Stornoway
and take to the high seas.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was aye hankerin&#39;, hankerin&#39; after the
machinery,&quot; he explained. &quot;A body canna serve
tables all his life. So after twa years on the Stornoway
I shippit as a fireman on a passenger steamer
outward bound frae Glasgow tae Bilbao. There
I left her, tae be second engineer on a wee tramp
carrying iron-ore tae the Mediterranean. That
was nigh twenty years ago, and I&#39;ve never set
fit in Scotland since. Weel, weel! Aha! Mphm!&quot;
(<i>Ad lib.</i> and <i>da capo</i>.)</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>
So he would discourse, in a manner which passed
many a weary hour for both, and added considerably
to Hughie&#39;s stock of human knowledge.</p>

<p class="indent">The days wore on. The work and long hours
were beginning to tell their tale, but the entire
crew kept grimly to it. Their nerves were in good
order too. Even when, on the morning of the
sixteenth day, as they groped their way through
a streaming wet fog, a great ghostly monster of a
liner suddenly loomed out of the wrack, and, as
she shouldered her way past them, actually scraped
the starboard counter with her stern, while the
look-out on her forward deck yelled frantically,
and a frightened man up aloft on the bridge flung
his wheel over with great rattling of steam steering-gear
to avoid a collision, the sole occupant
of the Orinoco&#39;s deck&mdash;it was Goble: he was
steering while Hughie and Walsh took their turn
in the stokehold and Allerton slept&mdash;did not
deem the occasion sufficiently important to merit
a report until he was relieved from duty two hours
later.</p>

<p class="indent">But this encounter provided that pawky philosopher
with a valuable clue as to their whereabouts.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She was a Ben liner,&quot; he intimated to Hughie
in describing the event. &quot;I saw the twa bit stripes
roond her funnel, and her name, Ben Cruachan,
on her stern. They&#39;re Glasgow boats, and sail
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
every other Thursday tae Buenos Ayres, calling
at Moville on Lough Foyle tae tak&#39; up Irish passengers.
It&#39;s no&#39; near Cape Clear we are, anyway.
We&#39;re somewhere off the north coast o&#39;
Ireland, sir. I kenned fine we were near land:
this is a ground swell that&#39;s throwin&#39; us aboot
noo. Aiblins we&#39;ll be gettin&#39; a dunt against the
Giant&#39;s Causeway if we&#39;re no&#39; canny.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was something in Goble&#39;s conclusions,
for after they had steamed dead slow all night
the rising sun licked up the fog; and there, ten
miles to the south of them, lay a long green seacoast;
and straight before them uprose what
looked like a rocky island, with a homely-looking
white lighthouse perched half-way up its rugged
face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If that land to the right is Ireland,&quot; said
Hughie, &quot;we can&#39;t be very far from Scotland. I
wonder what that great rock ahead of us can be.
Lucky we didn&#39;t reach it a couple of hours ago!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you think,&quot; suggested Allerton, putting
his head out of the engine-room hatchway,
&quot;that as we have a <i>pukka</i> Scot on board, we had
better rouse him up and see if he can identify his
native land?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was Goble&#39;s turn for sleep, but Allerton&#39;s suggestion
was adopted, and he was haled on deck.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you happen to recognise that island
straight ahead, Mr. Goble?&quot; inquired Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
Goble surveyed the rock and the lighthouse,
and though his countenance remained unmoved,
his eye lit up with proprietary pride.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Island? Yon&#39;s no&#39; an island,&quot; he replied.
&quot;&#39;Tis Scotland hersel&#39;. Sir, &#39;tis the Mull o&#39; Kintyre!
It rins straight awa&#39; back tae Argyllshire.
We&#39;re at the varra mouth o&#39; the Clyde. We micht
hae been drawed there across the Atlantic by a
bit string! God presairve us, it&#39;s a miracle!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Clyde?&quot; shouted Hughie. It seemed too
utterly good to be true. &quot;Are you sure, Goble?
Is that really the Mull?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sure?&quot; Goble&#39;s expression was a mixture of
pity and resentment. &quot;Man, I&#39;m tellin&#39; ye I
sailed roond it twice a week for the best pairt o&#39;
twa years. I was awfu&#39; sick the first time. The
second&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">All this time the Mull of Kintyre was growing
nearer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s the course?&quot; queried Walsh, leaning
over the bridge. &quot;Do I turn up New Cut, Mr.
Goble, or keep straight along the Blackfr&#39;ars
Road?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Everybody&#39;s spirits were soaring marvellously
at the sight of the blessed green land. Walsh&#39;s
wife was within twenty-four hours of him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Keep yon heap o&#39; stanes on your left hand,
ma mannie,&quot; replied the greatly inflated Goble,
facetiously indicating the towering headland before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
them, &quot;and then straight on Ailsa Craig.
You&#39;re daen&#39; fine. Mr. Marrable, will you rin her
up tae the Tail o&#39; the Bank, off Greenock, or gi&#39;e
a cry in at Campbeltown Bay? It&#39;s jist roond
the corner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hang it! we&#39;ll take her all the way, now we
have got so far,&quot; said Hughie. &quot;We&#39;re <i>home</i>!
I <i>was</i> reckoning on bringing up in Plymouth
Sound; but that&#39;s a detail. Come on, Allerton,
let&#39;s go below and fire up for the last time. We&#39;ll
bring her in in style!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And so it came about that not many hours
later the Orinoco, a rotting hulk, clogged with
weed, corroded with rust, caked with salt, feebly
churning up the water with her debilitated propeller,
steamed painfully but grandly past the
Cloch Light and into the mouth of the Clyde. A
sorry object she may have seemed to the butterfly
host of natty paddle-steamers which was
pouring down the river under the forced draught
of triple competition, carrying the Glasgow man,
released from office, to Dunoon and Rothesay
and other summer repositories for wife and
family. But to those who <i>knew</i>, she was no uncleanly
tramp, but a battle-scarred veteran,&mdash;a
ship that had deserved well of the Republic of
the high seas,&mdash;another little Golden Hind,
though laden with nothing nearer to Spanish ingots
than bottles of imitation French claret. Every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
scar on her sides was an honourable wound;
every groan and creak that rose from her starting
timbers a pæan; every cough and wheeze that
proceeded from her leaky cylinders a prayer of
joyful thanks. The Orinoco had graduated high
in the nameless but glorious band of those who
have illustrated, not altogether without profit and
pride, the homely truth that</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Life ain&#39;t holdin&#39; good cards;</span><br />
<span class="i0">It&#39;s playin&#39; a poor hand <i>well</i>!</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">And so she turned the last corner of her long
and painful Odyssey, and came home to lay up
her bones by the Clyde, which had given them
birth. And by a happy chance the unconscious
Hughie, instead of navigating her to the Tail of
the Bank as he had intended, changed his mind,
put over his helm, and conned her up to the head
of that beautiful Gareloch which, many many
years ago, had given the little ship her maiden
name.</p>

<p class="indent">There, swinging at her rusty cable, with the
clear green water laving her weary forefoot, and
the hills above Roseneath and Shandon smiling
reassuringly down upon her in the glow of the
evening sun, we will leave her. <i>Molliter ossa
cubent!</i></p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The law&#39;s delays are proverbial, and the task of
getting even with Mr. Noddy Kinahan involved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
Hughie in endless encounters with those in high
places, several appearances (with suite) in the
abodes of the Law, and another trip to New
York&mdash;by Cunarder this time.</p>

<p class="indent">However, grim determination will accomplish
most things; and when some months later Hughie
finally sailed from New York for his native land,
the labour of love had been completed, and Mr.
Noddy Kinahan was duly regretting, for a term
of years, the fact that he had ever been born.</p>

<p class="indent">This consummation was followed by another,
depressing but inevitable. The Orinoco Salvage
Company, having served its purpose, paid Nature&#39;s
debt and ceased to exist. The circumstances
connected with its demise, together with
the respective fates of Hughie&#39;s little band of Argonauts,
will best be gathered from the following
epistolary excerpts:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">No. I (N. B. <i>Spelling corrected</i>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">&#8453; <span class="smcap">Mistress Howieson,</span></p>
<p class="right">17 <span class="smcap">Candlish Street, Greenock.</span></p>

<p>To <span class="smcap">H. Marrable</span>, Esq.:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I thank you for cheque, and have disposed
of same. I also thank you for offer to find
a job for me. But I would prefer to bide by you,
as I feel I will not get a better job than that. I
would like fine to be your servant. You will be
needing some one to redd up your quarters and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
keep your clothes sorted, now you are ashore.
(Women is no&#39; to be trusted.) Of course I would
not want a big wage: the siller from the Orinoco
will do grandly for a long time. I ken fine the
way to wait at table and clean silver, having been
steward, as I once telled you, on the old Stornoway,
where they had a cuddy full of gentry every
trip.&mdash;Your servant (I am hoping),</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jno. Alex. Goble.</span></p>

<p class="center">No. II</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Extracts. No date or address, but obviously
written in a public-house</i>)</p>

<p class="indent">... So you must take the money back. It is
no use to me: all I should get out of it would be
a d&mdash;d bad headache. Also, it might give me
ideas above my station, which is bad for the lower
orders at any time. Give it to Walsh; but don&#39;t
let on, of course, that it comes from me: let him
believe that it is part of his natural share of the salvage.
I have kept back enough to pay for a new
suit (which I am now wearing) and one big bust
before I sail next week as deck steward on an
Aberdeen liner.</p>

<p class="indent">... Well, it was a great trip. We have all got
something out of it. You have got an adventure
and incidentally done a big thing, and I have
spent a month of absolute happiness in the society
of men who regarded me neither as an object
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
of pity nor as a monster of depravity, but
were content to let me go my own way as a man
who prefers to live his own life and be asked no
questions.... Your offer to set me on my
legs again and make me a respectable member of
society is friendly and, I suppose, natural; but
it threatens a happy episode with a sad ending.
I&#39;m not cut out for conventionality, and (<i>pace</i>
your kind references to my &quot;sterling merit and
latent force of character&quot;) I am not of the stuff
that successful men are made of. I have only
done two big things in my life. One was getting
elected to Pop at Eton, the other was helping
you to bring the old Orinoco home. I think I&#39;ll
rest on my laurels now. I suppose I was born a
rotter, and if you were to endeavour to raise me
to your giddy heights I should only fall down
again, and the bump at the bottom might hurt. I
am safer where I am: the beauty of lying on the
floor is that you can&#39;t fall off.</p>

<p class="indent">... Well, chin, chin! If I may be permitted
to gush for a moment, I should like to tell you that
you are a good sort.&mdash;Yours ever,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Lionel Allerton.</span></p>

<p class="center">No. III</p>

<p class="right">No. 4 <span class="smcap">Teak St., Limehouse.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I beg to acknowledge with thanks
your cheque for share of salvage. It was far more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
than I expected, and the Adm&#39;ty C&#39;ts have certainly
done well by us. At the best, I had hoped
for suffic&#39;nt to rig out the nippers with boots and
duds for the winter and give the missis a week
or two off the laundry work. We have all been
fair barmy the last few days. Square meals and
a big fire, and you can&#39;t hear yours&#39;lf talk for
the squeaking of the new boots. We are settling
down a bit now, and I have put the rest of the
money in the bank and told the old woman she
is to burn her wash-tubs. Catch her: I d&#39;n&#39;t think!
With my new clothes I have obt&#39;d a berth as
Chief on board s.s. Batavia, of the Imperial Line,
and sail on 21st inst. Her engines are (<i>several
lines of hopeless technicalities omitted</i>). It was a
lucky day for me when I struck the Orinoco, and
luckier when Angus doctored my grog.</p>

<p class="indent">On returning from voyage will take the lib&#39;ty
of calling on you in London at the address you
gave.&mdash;Yrs. respect&#39;fly,</p>

<h2><a name="chXI" id="chXI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="h3">SEALED ORDERS</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">On</span> a bright morning in April Hughie emerged
from the offices of Messrs. Slocum, Spink, and
Slocum, Solicitors, in Lincoln&#39;s Inn Fields, and
made for the Strand.</p>

<p class="indent">Like most men who have been abroad for a
long time, he trod the streets of London with
an oddly mingled sensation of familiarity and
strangeness. At one moment he felt that he had
been living in London for years, at another he
felt that he was exploring a new city. The Strand
itself, save for the old congested stretch in the
neighbourhood of Charing Cross, was almost
unrecognisable. Gone for ever were the various
landmarks of his youth, such as the Old Gaiety
and the Lowther Arcade. Holywell Street and
Wych Street, with their delectable environs, had
vanished like a bad but interesting dream, leaving
room for a broad and stately thoroughfare,
in the midst of which the churches of St. Mary
and St. Clement Danes split the traffic like boulders
in a Highland spate, and the Law Courts
acquired an unfamiliar prominence. A new fairway
of uncanny width and straightness clove its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
course to Holborn, blocked at its mouth by a
dismal patch of excavated territory resembling
nothing so much as what Scotsmen term a &quot;free
toom,&quot; and proclaiming to all and sundry, by
means of a gigantic notice-board, that This Site
was To Let as a Whole.</p>

<p class="indent">The traffic had developed too. There were
countless motor-buses, which shook the earth
and smelt to heaven; and taxicabs, which skipped
like rams and quacked like ducks.</p>

<p class="indent">But after all, though landmarks change their
bearings and banks be washed away, the stream
flows on unchanged. The people were the same,
and Hughie felt comforted. The smell of asphalt
was the same, and he felt uplifted. And when
he beheld the torrents of traffic that converge on
the Wellington Street crossing arrest their courses
<i>seriatim</i> and pile themselves up in a manner that
would have done credit to the waters of Jordan,
all at the bidding of an imperturbable figure in
a blue uniform, he felt that he was indeed home
once more.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently he hailed a taxicab, and whizzed
along, exulting like a child with a new toy, to
a railway station, where John Alexander Goble,
having previously superintended the placing of
his master&#39;s luggage in the train (with a maximum
of precaution on his part and a minimum of
profit on the porter&#39;s), was waiting to see him off.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
Hughie dismissed his retainer to take charge
of his newly acquired flat until his return, and
having secured his seat, followed his invariable
custom and went forward to view the engine.
He noted with interest that compound locomotives
seemed to have made little or no progress in the
country&#39;s favour, but that the prejudice against
high-pitched boilers and six-coupled wheels had
disappeared.</p>

<p class="indent">He then made his way to the refreshment room,&mdash;where
alone, he noted, Time&#39;s devastating
hand appeared to have stood still,&mdash;and having
lunched frugally off something from under a glass
dome which the divinity behind the counter, in
response to a respectful inquiry, brusquely described
as &quot;fourpence,&quot; together with as much
bitter beer as remained after the same damosel
had slapped its containing vessel playfully down
on the fingers of a pimply but humorous youth
who was endeavouring to tempt the appetites of
two wizened sardines, exposed for sale on a piece
of toast, with a hard-boiled egg from a neighbouring
plate, returned to his seat in the train;
where he was duly locked in by a porter, who
displayed an amount of cheerful gratitude for
sixpence that an American baggage-man would
have considered excessive at a dollar. Here, with
a rug, a pipe, and a quantity of illustrated papers,
most of which had come to birth since he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
left England, and all of which appeared to depend
for their livelihood on the exploitation of
the lighter lyric drama, Hughie settled himself
for a comfortable run along the Thames Valley.</p>

<p class="indent">This done, he took two letters from his pocket.
One had been opened already. It was an obviously
feminine production, and said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">&quot;<span class="smcap">Manors</span>, <i>Monday</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Dear Hughie</span>,&mdash;We are all thrilled to hear
that you are home at last. You must come down
here <i>at once</i> and be our guest until you have
looked round, and then you can renew all our
acquaintances at one go. There are lots of nice
people with us just now, so come! You will be
feeling lonely, poor thing, landing in this country
after so many years, and of course you will miss
poor Mr. Marrable sadly. I suppose you have
heard all about his death from the lawyers by
this time, or perhaps you saw it in the papers two
years ago.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. D&#39;Arcy is here; also Joan, of course. My
husband, too, wants to have the pleasure of entertaining
you&mdash;that is, if you are prepared not
to shoot him on sight! I don&#39;t <i>think</i>, though,
that I shall be able to command your regretful
affections any more. One look at me will be
sufficient for you. Alas, I have two chins and
three babies!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;However, come down on Saturday, and you
can size us all up. I suppose you know that Mr.
Marrable asked us to take Manors and look after
Joan until you or he came home again; so you
won&#39;t play the heavy landlord and evict us on
the spot, will you?&mdash;Yours ever,</p>

<p class="right">&quot;<span class="smcap">Mildred Leroy</span>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Hughie put this epistle away with a slightly
sentimental sigh. It did not seem so very long
since he had been organising May Week festivities
in Miss Mildred Freshwater&#39;s honour. Now&mdash;two
chins and three babies! <i>Eheu, fugaces!</i></p>

<p class="indent">The other letter had not yet been opened, and
Hughie broke the seal. The envelope looked
blue and legal, and its contents consisted of several
pages of Jimmy Marrable&#39;s stiff upright handwriting.
The date was nearly three years old.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;I am leaving England again&quot;&mdash;it began&mdash;&quot;next
week, and I doubt very much if I shall ever
come back. It is not in the breed to die in bed of
something stuffy. The only tie that keeps me
here is Joey, and she is too much occupied at
present in collecting scalps to pay much attention
to the old ruin who brought her up. In about four
years&#39; time she may be fit to live with again: at
present she is not; and I refuse point-blank for
the time being to play second fiddle to any young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
cub who ever wore magenta socks and a pleated
shirt. I think it quite time that you came home
and took her in hand. Indeed, if you don&#39;t appear
on the scene within two years, I have given
instructions that you are to be ferreted out and
asked to do so. When you do return you will receive
this letter, in which I am going to set down
the manner in which I wish my estate to be administered
on Joey&#39;s behalf if I don&#39;t come back.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In the first place, I must tell you that Manors
goes to you by entail, but that all the rest is Joey&#39;s,
and you will be her sole trustee and guardian.
Lance is of age, and independent, and I have
disposed of things in such a way that he can&#39;t
possibly interfere with the management of Joey&#39;s
affairs. Secondly, I want to tell you something
about the children themselves.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not their father, though I very nearly was,
and though every old shrew in the neighbourhood
thinks I am. Their mother was the most beautiful
and lovable girl I have ever known, and the
only woman in the world I ever cared a rap for.
Ours was a boy-and-girl idyll, though I was ten
years her senior. I had known her ever since I
could carry her on my back, and it was always a
sort of understood thing between us that we were
to marry each other when the time came.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Till she was nineteen and I twenty-nine, I
suppose we were the happiest couple under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
broad heaven. Then she let down her skirt and
put up her hair and made her <i>début</i>. (I should say
that she lived alone with her old father, a retired
East Indian of the time of John Company.) To
her own surprise and my great pride&mdash;at first&mdash;she
caused quite a sensation, for besides her face
she had the prettiest manners possible. If you
want to know what she was like you will find a
miniature of her among my papers. Or perhaps
it would be simpler to look at Joey.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But now the trouble began. Irene&mdash;that was
her name&mdash;soon discovered an immense appetite
for admiration, which was quite natural and excusable.
(One can&#39;t blame a girl for making all
the runs she can while her innings lasts; God
knows, it is short enough!) But presently she
could not do without it. She was always &#39;asking
for it,&#39; as they say nowadays. Sometimes she
made herself rather conspicuous, and people began
to smile at her. I ground my teeth, and,
finally, at the least suitable moment, I put my
oar in. I expostulated. No, I <i>didn&#39;t</i> expostulate:
I simply <i>ordered</i> her to mend her ways, and generally
acted the Grand Turk and proud proprietor
rolled into one. My word, Hughie, she was furious!
There had never been any definite engagement
between us, and she opened her defence by
saying so, pat. It happened at a ball, where she
had been making herself rather noticeable with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
a seedy ruffian&mdash;half actor, half poet&mdash;called
Gaymer, against whom I had been fool enough to
warn her. She informed me that she was her own
mistress, and that I was an officious busybody.
If I had had the sense to tell her there and then
that I loved her more than all the world, and that
I was jealous of the very ground she walked on,&mdash;let
alone the people she spoke to,&mdash;she would
have melted at once, I swear; for she was as impulsive
and generous as a child, and she loved
me, too, I <i>know</i>. If I had even lost my temper
and called her a brazen hussy, she would have
forgiven me in time: a woman regards a remark
like that as a sort of compliment. <i>But</i>&mdash;I smiled
indulgently, shrugged my shoulders, and said
that she would look at these things differently
when she was older.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That did it. Apparently there is only one
crime in this world more heinous than telling an
old woman that she is old, and that is to tell a
young woman that she is young. Irene got straight
up and left me sitting, and went home without
ever looking in my direction again that night.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Next day I called at her father&#39;s house to
make my peace. I was prepared to admit that I
had been an irritating young cub, and eat humble
pie generally. But I was too late. She was gone!
She had bolted, in some wild fit of pique or sentimentalism,
with that long-haired exponent of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
Byronism-and-water, Lance Gaymer, and had
married him at a Registry Office that very morning.
Probably she had fallen in with his proposals
at the ball&mdash;after her interview with me.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Hughie, I would rather pass over the
next few years. I cut her out of my scheme of
things as completely as I could, and went on my
way. Fortunately you began to engage my attention
about that time, and I rubbed along somehow,
and finally developed into the fine old crusted
fogey that you know me to be.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ten years later I heard from her. She sent
for me. I had never known where she was, nor
tried to find out. But I did not expect to find
her where I did. She was in a miserable dingy
house in Bloomsbury&mdash;dying, Hughie! Her ruffianly
husband had left her after her second baby
was born,&mdash;our Joey, that is,&mdash;and her old
father had been dead eight years. She had not a
friend in the world, and yet she would not turn
to me till it was too late. Pride, pride, pride! For
some years she had been struggling on with a
little money her father had left her, and which
her husband had not been able to get hold of,
and she had also taken in lodgers. <i>Lodgers</i>,
Hughie! It was only when she realised that she
was going out for good that the thought of the
kiddies&#39; future began to frighten her, and she
sent for me&mdash;at last!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was with her during most of the remaining
three months of her life, to the scandalisation of
virtuous Bloomsbury. I wanted to bring her to
Manors, which she had often visited in her childhood,
but she said she preferred to die in London;
and as she was obviously going to die somewhere
pretty soon, I did not press the point. During
that time we lived a life of almost perfect happiness;
and when she finally slipped away, quite
peacefully,&mdash;poor child! she was barely thirty-two,&mdash;and
I took the youngsters home with me,
the long waste of years behind us seemed almost as
though it never had been, so completely had the
recollection of it been wiped out by the intervening
three months. Love can work marvels,
Hughie, even though it come to a man at the
very last.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I may add that during the closing weeks of
her life I had the supreme satisfaction of marrying
her, as we received undeniable proof that
her accursed husband had died in South America.
This gives me a sort of additional hold over
Joey, though I have never mentioned it to her;
nor do I think it necessary, for I had rather that
her attachment to me remained a purely sentimental
one, for the present at any rate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And now, as regards the future. As I said
at the beginning of this letter, I don&#39;t know
whether I shall ever come back from this trip.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
If I don&#39;t, well and good: Joey can take my
money. If I do, I am afraid I must request the
use of it for myself for a little while longer. However,
you will naturally want me to fix some sort
of time-limit, and the question has been occupying
my attention a good deal. My original idea
was to make a kind of provisional will, leaving
all my property to Joey, and entitling her to
come into possession automatically in the event
of my not returning within five years; but the
lawyers tell me this arrangement won&#39;t work, as
I have to be <i>pukka</i> dead before they can shell
out. So I have fixed it this way. For the present
Joey will want nothing but her daily bread and
her fallals and a roof to sleep under, as her so-called
education is now completed. I have therefore
let Manors to the Leroys, on the understanding
that the child is to live there with them for
the present. (Not that they required much persuasion.)
She is eighteen at the time of writing
this letter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Further, I have realised practically all my
personal estate, and placed the cash to your credit
(on Joey&#39;s behalf) at the Law Courts Branch of
the Home Counties Bank. When you come home,
which I hope will be soon, I want you to take
this money and administer it for her benefit. The
rest of my property&mdash;nothing to speak of in comparison&mdash;is
set down and duly disposed of in my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
will (which I have left in the hands of Slocum,
Spink, and Slocum, Lincoln&#39;s Inn Fields), and
cannot be touched until my death is authenticated.
I have made you Joey&#39;s sole trustee and
guardian, and you will enter upon your duties as
soon as you get home. She is not to come of
age, financially speaking, until she is twenty-four.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s all, I think.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good luck to you in life, Hughie! I can&#39;t, I
fear, take my stand on the pinnacle of a successful
career and shout down advice to you
on your way up; neither will I presume to counsel
you as to your future. My only piece of advice
to you is not to expect much in this world,
and then you won&#39;t be disappointed. Roughly
speaking, there are only three things in life that
matter&mdash;health, money, and friends. A woman
once told me that the recipe for perfect happiness
is a million pounds and a good digestion.
The last, I admit, is indispensable. Well, you
have it: the Marrable interior is dyspepsia-proof.
The million pounds you have not got, and don&#39;t
want. Wealth, after all, is a purely relative affair.
You can measure it either by the greatness
of what you have or the smallness of what you
want. All that a man needs is enough of the first
to ensure his getting the second, and I am inclined
to think that in your case this should not
be a matter of much difficulty.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Besides, it is in the <i>small</i> needs of life that
money really counts. The yacht, the house in
town, the grouse moor&mdash;who wants &#39;em? But
the cab home in the rain; the occasional bottle of
Pommery; the couple of stalls when an old friend
looks you up, or the furtive and sympathetic
fiver when his widow does,&mdash;these are the things
that make money really worth having. Besides,
the greatest joys are those you have to save up for,
so a millionaire can never know them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As for friends&mdash;well, there are two classes,
men and women. Men I need not trouble you
about. If you haven&#39;t acquired the knack of
handling them during the last ten years you never
will, and are no Marrable. Women? I give it up!
You can&#39;t standardise them. Men are fairly
normal as a class. If you deal straight with a
man he will realise and appreciate the fact, and
though he may not respond by dealing straight
with you, he will at any rate recognise you for
what you are&mdash;a white man. But you can&#39;t
depend on a woman to do that. They are far
stronger in their likes and dislikes than we are,
and are hopelessly capricious into the bargain.
My general experience&mdash;and it has been wider
than you might think&mdash;has been that, once a
woman takes a fancy to you, you may run counter
to every canon of honesty, sobriety, and common
decency, and she will cleave to you&mdash;probably,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
I fancy, because you arouse all the protective
maternal instinct in her. On the other hand,
once you get into her bad books,&mdash;it may be
because you deserve it, but as often as not it is
because you have hot hands or once trod on her
skirt in a waltz,&mdash;nothing that you can do will
prevent her shuddering at the very mention of
your name. Perhaps, from the point of view of
the greatest good of the greatest number, a
woman&#39;s method of sizing up the male sex is the
best possible, but it comes hard on well-meaning
but heavy-handed men like us.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We Marrables have always been men&#39;s men,
although we have the profoundest reverence for
women. (Perhaps that is the reason: a woman
never wants you to reverence women; she wants
you to reverence <i>her</i>.) What sticks in our throats
is the enormous amount of make-believe and
shilly-shallying that has to go on between the
sexes before any definite business can be accomplished.
Whenever I see a Marrable in a drawing-room,
sitting on the edge of a chair and balancing
a teacup, I always know exactly what
he is there for, and I also know that he is dumbly
resisting man&#39;s primitive instinct to pick up the
right girl and <i>run</i>. When that feat, or its equivalent,
has been accomplished, all is well: I have
never known a Marrable who was not a complete
success as a husband. But they are bad starters.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your father was an exception. He had the
good luck to meet a girl who knew a man when
she saw one, and was willing to accept the will
for the deed when she found him unable to express
articulately what she would have loved to
hear. By a further stroke of good luck her parents
objected to him, so he had a comparative
walk-over.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And therefore, Hughie, I counsel you to escape
all future unhappiness by marrying Joey as
soon as you get home&mdash;a consummation to which,
as you will probably have gathered by this time,
the whole of these laboured and transparent
testamentary dispositions of mine are directed.
I have left the child entirely in your hands.
Marry her as quickly as you can, and then I
shall know for certain, whatever my state of
existence at the time, that the two people whom
I care for most on earth are both booked for a
life of perfect happiness. I could not wish a man
a sweeter wife or a woman a better husband.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Forgive my clumsy methods, but you know
I mean well.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<p class="right">&quot;<span class="smcap">James Marrable.</span>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Hughie folded up this characteristic document
and put it carefully back in his pocket. Then
he lit his pipe and reflected.</p>

<p class="indent">He did not altogether agree with the tone of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
his uncle&#39;s letter, but he knew in his heart that
it contained a good deal of truth. He was ready
to marry and settle down, but like most of his
race he contemplated the preliminary reconnoitring,
the man&oelig;uvring for position, and the
elaborate enveloping movements which seem
inseparable from a modern matrimonial engagement,
with something akin to terror. At the
same time, it seemed a tame thing to come home
and marry a bread-and-butter miss out of the
schoolroom to gratify the shade of a departed
relative.</p>

<p class="indent">The train slowed down. They were approaching
Midfield Junction, where he must change.
Hughie took his feet down from the opposite
cushions and knocked the ashes out of his pipe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; he said. &quot;I must have a look at
Joey first. Pretty children so often grow up
plain. Perhaps it would be simplest to marry
her, but there&#39;s no hurry. I&#39;m home for a rest,
and I&#39;m not going to bother myself. I have
roughed it for nine years. Now I&#39;m going to
settle down and have an easy time of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was never more mistaken in his life.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="chXII" id="chXII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="h3">A CHANGE OF ATMOSPHERE</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Miss Joan Gaymer</span> sat in a Windsor chair on
the landing outside the bathroom door at Manors.
It was half-past eight in the morning&mdash;an hour
when traffic outside bathroom doors is apt to be
congested.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Gaymer was wrapped in a bluish-grey
kimono, which, whether by accident or design,&mdash;I
fear there is very little doubt about it, really,&mdash;exactly
matched the colour of her eyes. At
the same time it failed to conceal the fact&mdash;<i>horresco
referens</i>&mdash;that she was still attired in what
American haberdashers call &quot;slumber-wear.&quot;
Her slim bare feet were encased in red slippers,
one of which dangled precariously from her right
big toe, and her hair hung down her back in
two tightly screwed but not unbecoming pigtails.
At present she was engaged in a heated altercation
with two gentlemen for right of entry into
the bathroom.</p>

<p class="indent">The only excuse that I can offer for her conduct
is that, although she was nearly twenty-one, in
her present setting she looked about fourteen.</p>

<p class="indent">The gentlemen, who wore large hairy dressing-gowns,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
with towels swathed round their necks
and mighty sponges in their hands, did not, it
must be confessed, show to such advantage as
their opponent. They were distinctly tousled
and gummy in appearance, and their wits, as is
usual with the male sex early in the morning,
were in no condition for rapier work. They had
both been patiently awaiting their turn for the
bath when Joan arrived, and they were now
listening in helpless indignation to a peremptory
order to return to their rooms and stay there
till sent for, and not to molest an unprotected
female on her way to her ablutions.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But look here, Joey,&quot; said one,&mdash;he was a
pleasant-faced youth of about nineteen,&mdash;&quot;we
were <i>both</i> here before you; and you know we
arranged last night that you were to come at
twenty past&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Binks,&quot; commanded the offender in the Windsor
chair, &quot;go straight back to your bedroom
and don&#39;t argue with me. If you are good I&#39;ll
give your door a tap on my way back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Binks was in no mood for compromise,
and furthermore wanted his breakfast.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s not playing the game,&quot; he grumbled;
&quot;I was here first, Cherub was second&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Who</i> isn&#39;t playing the game?&quot; flashed out
Miss Gaymer. &quot;Have you <i>shaved</i>, Binks?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Binks, taken in flank, admitted the impeachment,&mdash;which,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
it may be mentioned, was self-evident.
&quot;You haven&#39;t, either,&quot; was the best retort
he could make.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, but I&#39;ve brushed my teeth,&quot; said the ever-ready
Miss Gaymer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; pursued Binks desperately, &quot;you
haven&#39;t done your hair.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My lad,&quot; replied his opponent frankly, &quot;if
you were a woman and had to put things on
over your head, you wouldn&#39;t have done your
hair either.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Binks, utterly demoralised, fell out of the
fighting line.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Joey, <i>I&#39;ve</i> shaved,&quot; murmured the second
gentleman in a deprecating voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Gaymer turned a surprised eye upon him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Why</i>, Cherub, dear?&quot; she inquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cherub,&quot; who was still of an age to be exceedingly
sensitive on the subject of his manly
growth, blushed deeply and subsided. But his
companion was made of sterner stuff.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come along, Cherub!&quot; he said. &quot;Let&#39;s run
her into her bedroom and lock her in until we&#39;ve
bathed. Hang it! It&#39;s the third time she&#39;s done
it this week.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lay one finger on me, children,&quot; proclaimed
Miss Gaymer, &quot;and I&#39;ll never speak to either of
you again!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She made ready for battle by twining her feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
in and out of the legs of the Windsor chair, and
sat brandishing a loofah, the picture of outraged
propriety.</p>

<p class="indent">Her heartless opponents advanced to the attack,
and seizing the arms of the chair bore it swiftly,
occupant and all, down the passage. Joan, utterly
unprepared for these tactics, was at first too
taken aback to do anything but shriek and wield
the loofah; but shortly recovering her presence
of mind, she slipped off the seat, and, doubling
round her bearers, who were hampered by the
chair, scampered back towards the bathroom&mdash;only
to run heavily into the arms of an unyielding,
sunburned, and highly embarrassed gentleman,
who had been standing nervously on the
other side of the door of that apartment for the
last five minutes, awaiting an opportunity to
escape, and had suddenly emerged therefrom on
a dash to his bedroom, under the perfectly correct
impression that it was a case of now or never.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I <i>beg</i> your&mdash;Why, it&#39;s Hughie!&quot; cried
Joan. &quot;Yes, it <i>really</i> is!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They recoiled, and stood surveying each other.
It was their first meeting. Hughie, owing to a
breakdown on the branch line, had arrived late
the night before, after the ladies had gone to
bed. Joan and he had not set eyes on each other
for nine years.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Gaymer recovered her equanimity first.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
&quot;You&#39;re not a bit changed, Hughie,&quot; she observed
with a disarming smile. &quot;A little browner&mdash;that&#39;s
all. Am I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie did not answer for a moment. He was
genuinely astonished at what he had just seen,
and not a little shocked. Where young girls are
concerned, there is no greater stickler for propriety
than your man of the world; and this
sudden instance of the latter-day <i>camaraderie</i>
of young men and maidens had rather taken
Hughie&#39;s breath away. He felt almost as fluttered
as an early Victorian matron. Suddenly
he realised that he had been asked a question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Changed?&quot; he said haltingly. &quot;Well, it&#39;s
rather hard to say, until&mdash;until&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Until I&#39;ve got my hair up and more clothes
on?&quot; suggested Miss Gaymer. &quot;Perhaps you&#39;re
right. Still, I look rather nice, don&#39;t you think?&quot;
she added modestly, preening herself in the
kimono. &quot;However, you&#39;ll see me at breakfast.
Meanwhile I want you to hold those two boys
back while I get into the bathroom. Ta-ta, dears!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And with an airy wave of her hand to the unwashed
and discomfited firm of Dicky and
Cherub, who stood grinning sheepishly in the
background, Hughie&#39;s ward slipped under her
guardian&#39;s arm and disappeared into the bathroom,
with a swish of cærulean drapery and a
triumphant banging of the door.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
Half an hour later Hughie descended to breakfast,
there to be greeted by his host, Jack Leroy,
a retired warrior of thirty-eight, of comfortable
exterior and incurable laziness, and his wife, the
one-time render of Hughie&#39;s heart-strings in the
person of Miss Mildred Freshwater. Another
old friend was the Reverend Montague D&#39;Arcy,
whom we last saw dancing the Cachuca by the
waters of the Cam. Here he was, a trifle more
rotund and wearing Archidiaconal gaiters, but
still the twinkling-eyed D&#39;Arcy of old. One or
two other guests were seated at the table, but as
yet there was no sign of Joey. When she did
appear, it was in a riding-habit; and after a
hearty meal, in no way accelerated by urgent
and outspoken messages from the front door,
where her swains were smoking the pipe of
patience, she dashed off in a manner which
caused most of those who were over-eating
themselves round the table to refer enviously
to the digestive equipment of the young, and
left Hughie to be entertained by his host and
hostess.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ll find her a queer handful, Hughie,&quot;
said Mrs. Leroy, as she sat placidly embroidering
an infantine garment in the morning sun on the
verandah,&mdash;in the corner of which the current
issues of the &quot;Spectator&quot; and &quot;Sporting Life,&quot;
fully unfurled, together with two pairs of perpendicular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
boot-soles and a cloud of cigar-smoke,
proclaimed the fact that the Army and the Church
were taking their ease together,&mdash;&quot;but I want
you to remember all the time that she is <i>sound</i>.
You&#39;ll be tempted to disbelieve that over and
over again, but don&#39;t! She has been utterly spoiled
by everybody, and you must give her time to
find her level again. Left to herself, she would
be as good as gold. I don&#39;t say she wouldn&#39;t do
something rather <i>outré</i> now and then from sheer
animal spirits, but that doesn&#39;t count. She&#39;s
young, of course, so she can&#39;t&mdash;she can&#39;t be expected
to&mdash;you know what I mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stand corn,&quot; remarked a voice from behind
the &quot;Sporting Life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, dear: that&#39;s just it. You see,
Hughie, men egg her on,&mdash;they&#39;re all alike:
Jack and Mr. D&#39;Arcy are as bad as any,&mdash;and
she gets excited and carried away, and occasionally
she does something stupid and conspicuous.
Five minutes later she is bitterly ashamed, and
comes and cries her heart out to me. People know
nothing about <i>that</i>, of course: all they do know
is that she did the stupid thing, and they call
her a forward little cat and a detestable imp.
Don&#39;t you believe them, Hughie!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you&#39;ll find her absurdly impulsive and
generous: you could have the clothes off her
back if you wanted them. The other day she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
came home in floods of tears because of a story
which a beggar-woman with a baby had told
her. It was the usual sort of story, but it was
quite enough for Joey. She had carried the baby
herself for about two miles, and given the mother
all the money she had, and made her promise
faithfully to come and see me next day. Of course
the woman never turned up, and Joey&#39;s blouse
had to be burned,&mdash;<i>oh</i>, that baby!&mdash;but that
sort of thing doesn&#39;t alter her faith in human
nature. And she stands the <i>great</i> test, Hughie.
She hasn&#39;t got one set of manners when men are
about and another when they are not. But she&#39;s
a kittle creature. You must be tender with her,
and&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Run her on the snaffle, old man&mdash;what?&quot;
corroborated the &quot;Sporting Life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie blew through his pipe meditatively.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Seems to me, Mrs. Leroy,&quot; he said at length,
&quot;that I&#39;m in for a pretty thick time. Do you
think she&#39;s at all likely to take to my present
methods, or must I learn some new tricks?
Afraid I&#39;m not much of a lady&#39;s man. Still, Joey
and I used to be great friends, once. Won&#39;t that
count for something?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; said Mrs. Leroy. &quot;You know
how the young loathe being thought young, or
reminded of their youth? Joey is just in that
frame of mind at present. Because you were a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span>
boy of twenty-one when she was a child of twelve,
she may darkly suspect you of desiring to continue
on the footing of those days. Don&#39;t do
that, for mercy&#39;s sake! For all practical purposes
you are much nearer to each other in age
than you were&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A chuckle reverberated through the peaceful
verandah, and the &quot;Spectator&quot; and &quot;Sporting
Life&quot; converged for a moment as if to share a
confidence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jack,&quot; inquired Mrs. Leroy sternly, &quot;what
were you saying to Mr. D&#39;Arcy just now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothin&#39;, dear,&quot; said a meek voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. D&#39;Arcy, what was he saying to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. D&#39;Arcy took in a reef in the &quot;Spectator&quot;
and replied suavely,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He made use of a sporting expression, dear
lady, with regard to your plans for our friend
Marrable&#39;s future, which I was happily unable
to understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jack,&quot; said Mrs. Leroy in warning tones,
&quot;people who put their oar in uninvited get taken
out for afternoon calls&mdash;in the brougham, with
both windows up!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The &quot;Sporting Life&quot; was promptly expanded
to its full extent, and silence reigned again. Presently
Mrs. Leroy observed cheerfully,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By the way, Hughie, you are home just in
time for a dance&mdash;the Hunt Ball.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
Hollow groans burst from behind the newspapers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, look here!&quot; said Hughie frankly. &quot;I
mean&mdash;not really?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes: I promised Nina Fludyer to back her
up and bring a &#39;bus-load of people. Why don&#39;t
you want to come?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, for one thing I have only danced twice
since I went down from Cambridge. One time
was at a Viceregal reception in Calcutta, and
the other was in Montmartre&mdash;under less formal
conditions. I&#39;ll tell you what&mdash;you and your
house-party go to the ball and enjoy yourselves,
and your husband and I will keep each other
company here&mdash;eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Captain Leroy put down his paper and said,
&quot;Good scheme!&quot; in the loyal but mournful tones
of one who realizes that it is a forlorn hope, but
that one might as well have a shot for it. &quot;In
fact, dear,&quot; he continued desperately, &quot;I was
thinkin&#39; of takin&#39; Marrable out that very night
to lie out for poachers. Old Gannet was tellin&#39;
me that the North Wood&mdash;that is&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He observed his wife&#39;s withering eye, and became
suddenly interested in the advertisements
on the back page of his periodical.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jack,&quot; said Mrs. Leroy in a tone of finality,
&quot;on Tuesday night you put on your best bib and
tucker and come with us&mdash;that&#39;s flat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
&quot;All right, m&#39; dear,&quot; replied her husband in a
voice which said to Hughie, &quot;I was afraid it
wouldn&#39;t work, old man!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And why don&#39;t <i>you</i> want to come, Hughie?&quot;
continued Mrs. Leroy, suddenly turning on her
guest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I am not cut out for balls,&quot; said Hughie.
&quot;Prefer the open air, somehow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If open air is all you want,&quot; remarked Mrs.
Leroy grimly, &quot;the Town Hall at Midfield is the
draughtiest building in the county.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Balls are dull affairs,&quot; urged the faithful but
misguided Leroy, &quot;compared with the excitement
and&mdash;er&mdash;suspense&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you want excitement and suspense,&quot; replied
the inexorable Mrs. Leroy, &quot;dance the
Lancers with Lady Fludyer&mdash;fifteen stone of
imperfectly balanced <i>blanc-mange</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And just a spice of risk&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Risk? My dear boy, try the Ball Committee&#39;s
champagne!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Captain Leroy, defeated at all points, once
more subsided; but D&#39;Arcy took up the argument.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Joking apart, Mrs. Leroy,&quot; he said, &quot;it&#39;s an
awful thing to be a supernumerary man at a
dance in the country. You crawl in at the tail
of your party, and shake hands with the governess,
under the impression that she is your hostess.
You are introduced to a girl, and book a dance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
You don&#39;t catch her name, so you write down
&#39;Red hair and bird of paradise&#39; on your programme,
and leave her. Of course you know
nobody; so, after booking a few more wallflowers,
you still find a good deal of time at your
disposal. You can always tell a male wallflower.
Women can usually brazen it out: they put on
an air which implies that they have refused
countless offers, and are sitting on a hard bench
because they like it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They can&#39;t deceive the other women, though,&quot;
said Mrs. Leroy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Still,&quot; agreed Hughie, &quot;they impose on men
all right. But, as D&#39;Arcy says, a male wallflower
is hopeless. He looks miserable, and either mopes
in a corner like a new boy at school, or else reads
away at his programme and peers about for a
partner who isn&#39;t on it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not try the smoking-room?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The smokin&#39;-room,&quot; interpolated Leroy, &quot;is
all right for the regular Philistine. But if <i>I</i> go
there, I find it in possession of a bilious octogenarian
and a retired major-general. They are sittin&#39;
in front of the fire with a cigar apiece. They glare
at me when I come in, and then go on buckin&#39; to
each other. Presently they stop, and one says: &#39;I
suppose you are not a dancin&#39; man, sir,&#39; in a way
which implies that he doesn&#39;t know what the
devil young men are comin&#39; to nowadays. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
by this time I&#39;m so ashamed of myself that I
simply bolt out of the room, with some yarn about
a brief rest between two dances, and go and sit
among the hats and coats in the cloak-room until
it is time to go and hunt up the next freak on my
programme. Rotten job, I call it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Leroy surveyed the three orators with an
air of serene amusement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I <i>have</i> roused a storm,&quot; she said. &quot;But you
are coming on Tuesday&mdash;all three! Now, Hughie,
I know Jack is dying to take you round the
stables and plantations. When you have smacked
all the horses&#39; backs and taken the pheasants&#39;
temperatures, come in. I want to introduce you
to my offspring. You are fond of children, I
know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know I shall be fond of yours, Mildred,&quot;
said Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you&mdash;that&#39;s nicely put. But they
really are rather pets, though I say it who
shouldn&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rum little beggars,&quot; mused the male parent.
&quot;Bite your head off if they see you havin&#39; a
sherry and bitters before dinner. Got a sort of
religious maniac of a nurse,&quot; he explained. &quot;Been
saved, and all that. Save <i>you</i> for tuppence,
Marrable!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s a queer old thing,&quot; said Mrs. Leroy,
&quot;but such a good nurse that her weaknesses don&#39;t
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
matter much. The children are never sick or
sorry&mdash;wait till I tap wood! your head will do,
Jack&mdash;and simply love her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was pleased to learn from their own lips,&quot;
remarked D&#39;Arcy, &quot;that they have been enthusiastic
teetotalers from birth, and are both ardent
supporters of Foreign Missions.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the baby?&quot; inquired Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Too young,&quot; replied Leroy; &quot;but that doesn&#39;t
excuse the poor little sinner from havin&#39; to wear
a blue ribbon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How does the nurse regard you, Leroy?&quot;
asked D&#39;Arcy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lost sheep&mdash;hard case&mdash;bad egg generally,&quot;
replied that gentleman resignedly. &quot;She&#39;s given
me up, I&#39;m glad to say; but she&#39;ll be on Hughie&#39;s
track in no time. Come along.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In the joy of roaming round the familiar plantations
and stables Hughie allowed the existence
of Mildred Leroy&#39;s offspring to fade from his
memory; and it was not until the party gathered
for luncheon that he was reminded of the introduction
in store for him.</p>

<p class="indent">The assembled company consisted of the host
and hostess, D&#39;Arcy, Hughie, Joan, and the young
gentleman previously referred to as &quot;Cherub.&quot;
The others had departed on a sailing expedition.
Joan had declined to go, alleging that she must
stay at home and entertain her &quot;keeper,&quot; as she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
had now christened Hughie; and Cherub had
speciously pleaded a tendency to <i>mal de mer</i>,
and remained at home to steal a march on his
rivals.</p>

<p class="indent">The party was completed by two chubby infants
of seven and five, in large pinafores and
short white socks, who were presented to Brevet-Uncle
Hughie as Theodora and Hildegard, though
Hughie discovered, after a brief experience of
their society, that they answered without resentment
and much more spontaneity to the appellations
of &quot;Duckles&quot; and &quot;Stodger&quot; respectively.</p>

<p class="indent">They were deposited&mdash;it seems the right word&mdash;in
the dining-room by an austere and elderly
female, who groaned heavily at the sight of Captain
Leroy, and eyed Hughie with unconcealed
distrust before withdrawing. The small girls took
their places one on each side of their mother, and
sat, like two well-bred little owlets, taking stock
of their new uncle. Presently their vigilance relaxed.
It is a truism that teetotalers are hearty
eaters, and the consumption of what was placed
before them soon occupied the attention of
Mesdames Duckles and Stodger to the exclusion
of all else, the latter exhibiting a particularly
praiseworthy attention to duty.</p>

<p class="indent">Their sole contribution to the conversation
was offered when Leroy passed the claret to
Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
&quot;Wine,&quot; remarked Duckles severely, &quot;is a
mocker!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stwong dwink,&quot; corroborated Stodger, turning
up the whites of her eyes, &quot;is raging!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The two ladies then groaned heavily in concert,
and, having thus contributed their mite to the redemption
of a sinner, resumed their repast.</p>

<p class="indent">At the end of the meal the numbers of the
company were augmented by the arrival of
John Marrable Leroy, aged two years&mdash;an infant
whose apoplectic countenance sadly belied the
small piece of blue ribbon inserted in his bib.
Having taken his seat in his mother&#39;s lap, he
proceeded, after the manner of babies, to give
his celebrated entertainment. For the benefit of
the company he obligingly identified various
articles upon the table, and then proceeded to
give an exposition (assisted by manual contortions)
of the exact whereabouts of the Church,
the Steeple, the Door, and the People. After
this, without warning or apology, he deposited
a nude foot in his mother&#39;s plate, having in
some mysterious manner got rid of his shoe and
sock under the table; and was proceeding to
enumerate the respective marketing experiences
of a family of little pigs, when his mother, deciding
that it was high time this <i>séance</i> came to
an end, called upon him to say grace on behalf
of the company.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
John Marrable Leroy reluctantly ceased fingering
his toes, and twisted himself into a state of devotional
rigidity. He then closed his eyes, folded
his hands, and breathed stertorously. All waited
with devoutly bowed heads for his benediction.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;T&#39;ank God&mdash;&quot; began Master Leroy at length.</p>

<p class="indent">There was another tense pause.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;T&#39;ank God&mdash;&quot; repeated the infant despondently.</p>

<p class="indent">Another hiatus.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;<i>For</i>&#39;&mdash;dearest,&quot; prompted his mother.</p>

<p class="indent">A smile of intense relief illuminated the supplicant&#39;s
troubled countenance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&mdash;Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten!&quot; he
gabbled cheerfully; and the meeting broke up in
unseemly confusion.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">It was a hot afternoon, and Hughie, who as
yet was far from getting tired of doing nothing,
was well content to sprawl in a basket-chair
under a great copper-beech, and watch the
others play croquet.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently Joan, swinging a mallet, came and
sat on the grass beside him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Hughie?&quot; she began, regarding her
comptroller rather quizzically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Joey?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then they both laughed, or rather chuckled.
The curious part about it was that while Hughie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
laughed &quot;Ha, ha!&quot; deep down, Joey did the same.
Tee-heeing and high-pitched feminine shrieking
were beyond her compass. She was the Joey of
old, with the same gruff voice, though she had
got over her difficulty with the <i>r</i>&#39;s and <i>l</i>&#39;s.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It seems rummy,&quot; observed Miss Gaymer reflectively,
&quot;my being put in your charge like the
guard of a train. Do you expect me to obey you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Hughie. He felt he was missing
an opportunity of saying something bright and
striking, but &quot;Yes&quot; was the only word he could
think of besides &quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; replied Miss Gaymer enigmatically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you intend to?&quot; inquired Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, it depends on what you tell me to do.
If it was anything that didn&#39;t matter much I
might do it, sometimes, just to save your face.
But as a rule I shouldn&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; said Hughie, in his turn.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I may as well tell you at once,&quot; continued the
lady, &quot;the things that it&#39;s no use scolding me
about. First of all, I always choose my own
friends, and never take recommendations or
warnings from anybody. Then you mustn&#39;t interfere
with my dancing or sailing or riding,
because I love them better than anything in the
world. Then, you mustn&#39;t try to prevent my
reading books and seeing plays that you think
are bad for me, because that sort of thing is simply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
not <i>done</i> nowadays. And of course you mustn&#39;t
call me extravagant if I dress nicely. Also, you
mustn&#39;t expect me to go in for good works, because
I hate curates. And don&#39;t give me advice,
because I loathe it. On the other hand, it may
comfort you to know&mdash;it does <i>most</i> men, for
some reason&mdash;that I don&#39;t want a vote and I
don&#39;t smoke cigarettes. Oh, the poor little mite!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was on her feet and across the lawn in a
flash, to where the obese Stodger, prostrate upon
a half-buried tree-root, was proclaiming to the
heavens the sorrow of a sudden transition from the
perpendicular to the horizontal. She comforted
the child with whole-hearted tenderness, and
after taking her turn in the game of croquet, returned
to Hughie and sat down beside him again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well&mdash;what do you think of me?&quot; she inquired
suddenly.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie regarded her intently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know yet,&quot; he said. &quot;I want to see a
little more of you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Most people,&quot; said Miss Gaymer with dignity,
&quot;make up their minds about me at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I won&#39;t do that,&quot; said Hughie. &quot;It wouldn&#39;t
be quite fair.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Joan pondered this retort and finally flushed
like a child.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That means that you have taken a dislike to
me,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
&quot;I didn&#39;t mean it that way,&quot; said Hughie,
much distressed,&mdash;&quot;really!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anyhow, it means that you haven&#39;t made up
your mind about me,&quot; persisted Joan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is true,&quot; admitted Hughie, who was no
hand at fencing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, do it soon,&quot; said Miss Gaymer. &quot;I&#39;m
not accustomed to being put on trial. I may mention
to you,&quot; she added complacently, &quot;that I am
considered a great success. Do you know what
Jacky Penn told me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; what?&quot; inquired Hughie perfunctorily.
He was beginning to understand the inwardness
of Mildred Leroy&#39;s warning that the girl beside
him had not yet found her feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He told me,&quot; said Joan, with an unaffected
sigh of pleasure, &quot;that the men here all call me
&#39;The Toast.&#39; What do you say to that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A Toast,&quot; said Hughie rather heavily, &quot;is
usually &#39;an excuse for a glass.&#39; I shouldn&#39;t like
to think of you merely as that, Joey.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Gaymer eyed her guardian with undisguised
exasperation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hughie, you have got fearfully old-maidish
in the last nine years,&quot; she said. &quot;Where have
you been? In any decent society?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sometimes; but not often. Not what <i>you</i>
would call decent society, Joey.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; remarked Miss Gaymer, turning her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
opponent&#39;s flank with characteristic readiness,
&quot;whatever it was, it wasn&#39;t very particular about
clothes. Hughie, your get-up is perfectly <i>tragic</i>.
If you are going to be my keeper you will have
to begin by dressing decently. I don&#39;t know who
your tailor is, but&mdash;Che-e-erub!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What ho!&quot; came from the croquet-lawn.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come here, at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Cherub obediently put down his mallet and
approached. Having arrived, he halted and stood
to attention.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cherub,&quot; commanded Miss Gaymer, &quot;turn
round and round till I tell you to stop, and let
Mr. Marrable see your clothes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Much flattered, Cherub rotated serenely on his
axis for the benefit of the untutored Marrable,
while Miss Gaymer ran over his points.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Must I have a waist?&quot; inquired Hughie meekly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes&mdash;if you&#39;ve <i>got</i> one,&quot; replied Joan, surveying
her guardian&#39;s amorphous shooting-jacket
doubtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And purple socks?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Green will do, old man,&quot; remarked the <i>mannequin</i>
unexpectedly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cherub, keep quiet!&quot; said the <i>coutumière</i>.
&quot;You have absolutely nothing whatever to recommend
you but your clothes, so don&#39;t spoil it by
babbling. There, Hughie! That is the sort of
thing. You must go up to town next week and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span>
order some. Run away, Cherub! Now, another
thing, Hughie. Look at your hands. They&#39;re
like a coal-heaver&#39;s, except that they&#39;re clean.
Can&#39;t you get them attended to?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie surveyed his hands in a reminiscent
fashion. They were serviceable members, and had
pulled their owner through many rough places.
At present the palms bore the mark of the Orinoco&#39;s
coal-shovels, and there was a great scar
on one wrist where Hughie had incautiously
touched a hot bearing. There was also an incision
in the middle knuckle of the right hand,
caused by the impact of Mr. Gates&#39;s front teeth
on an historic occasion. There were other and
older marks, and most of them had some interesting
story attached to them. But of course Joan
did not know this. To her they were large, unsightly,
un-manicured hands&mdash;only that and
nothing more. Hughie sighed. All his old assets
seemed to have become liabilities, somehow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aren&#39;t they a scandal, Hughie?&quot; Joan repeated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose they are, Joey,&quot; said Hughie, coming
out of his reverie. &quot;Right O! I&#39;ll get them
seen to. I don&#39;t suppose they&#39;re ever likely to be
much use to me again,&quot; he added in a depressed
tone, &quot;so they might as well be made ornamental.
I&#39;ll go and consult Sophy Fullgarney about
them when I get back to town.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
&quot;Who&#39;s she?&quot; said Joey quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Manicurist&mdash;before your time,&quot; said Hughie
briefly, pleased to feel that he could give points
to his ward in knowledge of something. &quot;Any
more requirements, Joey?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me see. Oh, yes. Can you dance?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Used to waltz,&quot; said Hughie cautiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Decently?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can get round a room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you reverse properly?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If a man reversed in my young days,&quot; said
Hughie, &quot;we used to regard him as a bounder.
Do they do it now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, always. Can you do anything else?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The usual things&mdash;Lancers and polka.
Danced a reel once in Scotland.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nobody dances the polka now, and I hate the
Lancers. Can you two-step?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never even heard of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Gaymer sighed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never heard of the Boston, I suppose?&quot; she
said resignedly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never in my life,&quot; said Hughie. &quot;Look here,&quot;
he added, inspired by a sudden hope, &quot;perhaps it
would be as well if I stayed at home on Tuesday
night&mdash;eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Quite</i> as well,&quot; said Miss Gaymer candidly.
&quot;But I don&#39;t suppose Mildred will let you off.
You&#39;ll be wanted by the wallflowers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
&quot;But not by Joey, apparently.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t dance with rotters,&quot; said Miss Gaymer
elegantly. &quot;I am practically booked up already,
too. However, if you apply at once I might give
you <i>one</i>.&quot; She thought for a moment. &quot;I&#39;ll try
you with number eight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We had better not settle at present,&quot; said
Hughie. &quot;I should like to have a look round
the ballroom before I tie myself down in any way.
But I&#39;ll bear your application in mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Joan Gaymer turned and regarded her
companion with unfeigned astonishment. He was
still sprawling, but his indolent pose of lazy contentment
was gone, and for a moment challenge
peeped out of his steely eyes. She rose deliberately
from the grass, and walked with great stateliness
back to the croquet-lawn.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie sat on, feeling slightly breathless. He
had just realised that he possessed a temper.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently Mrs. Leroy completed a sequence of
five hoops and retired, followed by the applause
of an incompetent partner, to the copper-beech.</p>

<p class="indent">She sat down opposite Hughie, and surveyed
him expectantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Hughie?&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Mildred?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Well</i>, Hughie?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think,&quot; said Hughie, answering the unspoken
question, &quot;that she wants&mdash;<i>slapping</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
Mildred Leroy nodded her head sagely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; she remarked. &quot;I thought you would
say that. Well, I hope you&#39;ll do it.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Hughie reviewed the events of the day, <i>more
suo</i>, at three o&#39;clock next morning, sitting with his
feet on the sill of his open bedroom window,&mdash;the
bedroom of his boyhood, with the old school
and &#39;Varsity groups upon the walls,&mdash;as he
smoked a final pipe before retiring to rest.</p>

<p class="indent">It was almost dawn. The velvety darkness was
growing lighter in texture; and occasionally an
early-rising and energetic young bird would utter
a tentative chirrup&mdash;only to subside, on meeting
with no encouragement from the other members
of the orchestra (probably trades unionists), until
a more seasonable hour.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie had sat on with D&#39;Arcy and Leroy in
the billiard-room long after the other men&mdash;Joey&#39;s
<i>clientèle</i>&mdash;had emptied their glasses and
gone to bed. There had been a &quot;ladies&#39; night,&quot;
accompanied by fearsome games (of a character
detrimental to the table) between sides captained
by Joey and another damsel; and even after Mildred
Leroy had swept her charges upstairs there
had been bear-fighting and much shrieking in the
passages and up the staircase. Then the younger
gentlemen had returned, rumpled but victorious,
to quench their thirst and listen with respectful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
deference to any tale that the great Marrable
might care to unfold. (The story of the Orinoco
had gone round, though it had mercifully escaped
the notice of the halfpenny papers.)</p>

<p class="indent">But Hughie had not been communicative,
though he had proved an eager and appreciative
listener to &#39;Varsity gossip and athletic &quot;shop.&quot;
So the young men, having talked themselves to a
standstill, had gradually faded away, highly
gratified to find the great man not only willing but
eager to listen to their meticulous chronicles; and
Hughie and D&#39;Arcy and Leroy, their symposium
reduced to companionable limits, had compared
notes and &quot;swapped lies,&quot; as the Americans say,
far into the night.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie&#39;s impressions of the day were slightly
blurred and confused&mdash;at the which let no man
wonder. He was accustomed to fresh faces and
new environments, but the plunge from yesterday
into to-day had been a trifle sudden. Last
night he had driven up to the door of Manors a
masterless man, a superior vagabond, an irresponsible
free-lance, with hundreds of acquaintances
and never a friend. In twenty-four hours
this sense of irresponsible detachment had gone
for ever, and the spell of English home-life had
sunk deep into his being. He felt for the first
time that he was more than a mere unit in the
Universe. He had turned from something into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
somebody. He realised that he had a stake in
the country&mdash;the county&mdash;the little estate of
Manors itself; and a great desire was upon him
to settle down and surround himself with everything
that is conveyed to an Englishman here
and abroad&mdash;especially abroad&mdash;by the word
Home.</p>

<p class="indent">Then there were the people with whom he had
come in contact that day. They were nearly all
old friends, but they were old friends with new
faces. There was Mildred Leroy, for instance.
He had half expected his relations with that
young matron, the past considered, to be of a
slightly tender and sentimental nature. Far from
it. Her attitude to him was simply maternal&mdash;as,
indeed, it had been, had he realised the fact,
from the very beginning of their friendship. A
woman always feels motherly towards a man
of her own age, and rightly, for she is much
older than he is. Occasionally she mistakes this
motherly feeling for something else, and marries
him&mdash;but not often. Obviously Mildred Leroy
now regarded Hughie as nothing more than an
eligible young <i>débutant</i>, the chaperon&#39;s natural
prey, to be rounded up and paired off with all
possible despatch.</p>

<p class="indent">Then there was Joey. Twenty-four hours ago
he had had no particular views on the subject of
his ward, beyond&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
(1) The reflection that he would probably find
her &quot;rather a bore&quot;;</p>

<p class="indent">(2) An idle speculation as to whether, if expediency
should demand it, he would be able to
bring himself to marry her.</p>

<p class="indent">Well, twenty-four hours is a long time. He
saw now quite clearly that whatever Miss Gaymer&#39;s
shortcomings might be, a tendency to bore
her companions was not one of them; and that
if ever the other question should arise, the difficulty
would lie, not in bringing himself to marry
Joey, but in bringing Joey to marry him.</p>

<p class="indent">Like a sensible man, he decided to let things
work themselves out in their own way, and went
to bed. There he dreamed that Joey, attired
in a blue kimono and red slippers, was teaching
him to dance the two-step to a tune played by
the engines of the Orinoco.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chXIII" id="chXIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>VARIUM ET MUTABILE</i></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Hughie</span> continued during the next few weeks to
study the character of the female sex as exemplified
by his ward Miss Joan Gaymer, and some
facts in natural history were brought to his notice
which had not hitherto occurred to him.</p>

<p class="indent">In her relations with her male belongings a
woman does not expect much. Certainly not
justice, nor reason, nor common sense. That
which she chiefly desires&mdash;so those who know
inform us&mdash;is admiration, and, if possible, kindness,
though the latter is not essential. The one
thing she cannot brook is neglect. Attention of
some kind she must have. Satisfy her soul with
this, and she will remain all you desire her to
remain,&mdash;<i>toute femme</i>,&mdash;something for lonely
mankind to thank God for. Stint her, and there
is a danger that she will drift into the ranks of
that rather pathetic third sex, born of higher
education and feminine superfluity, which to-day
stands apart from its fellow-creatures and loudly
proclaims its loathing for the masculinity of man
and its contempt for the effeminacy of woman,
but which seems so far only to have cast away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span>
the rapier of the one without being able to lift
or handle the bludgeon of the other.</p>

<p class="indent">Not that Miss Joan Gaymer ran any such risk.
She was indeed <i>toute femme</i>, and stood secure
from the prospect of being cut off from her natural
provender. Her chief danger was that of a
surfeit. She possessed a more than usually healthy
appetite for admiration, and there was never
wanting a supply of persons&mdash;chiefly of her own
sex, be it said&mdash;to proclaim the fact that in her
case the line between appetite and gluttony was
very finely drawn indeed. There was some truth,
it is to be feared, in the accusation, for Joan was
undoubtedly exhibiting symptoms at this time of
a species of mental indigestion&mdash;what the French
call <i>tête montée</i> and the Americans &quot;swelled
head&quot;&mdash;induced by an undiluted diet of worship
and homage. Appetite for this sort of thing
grows with eating, and Joan, like her mother before
her, was beginning to think too much of those
who supplied her with the meat her soul loved
and too little of those who did not. And as those
who did not were chiefly those who had her welfare
most nearly at heart, she was deprived for
the time being of a good deal of the solid sustenance
of real friendship.</p>

<p class="indent">She was a curious mixture of worldly wisdom
and naïveté, and was frankly interested in herself.
She was undisguisedly anxious to know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
what people thought of her, and made no attempt
to conceal her pleasure when she found
herself &quot;a success.&quot; On the other hand, she presumed
a great deal too much on the patience and
loyalty of her following. She was always captious,
frequently inconsiderate, and, like most young
persons who have been respectably brought up,
was desperately anxious to be considered rather
wicked.</p>

<p class="indent">These facts the slow-moving brain of Hughie
Marrable absorbed one by one, and he felt vaguely
unhappy on the girl&#39;s account, though he could
not find it in his heart to blame her. Joey, he
felt, was merely making full use of her opportunities.
Within her small kingdom, and for her
brief term, she held authority as absolute as that,
say, of a secretary of state, nor was she fettered
by any pedantic scruples, such as might have
hampered the official in question, about exercising
the same; and Hughie, who was something
of an autocrat himself, could not but admit that
his ward was acting very much, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>,
as he would have done under similar circumstances.</p>

<p class="indent">But as time went on and his sense of perspective
adjusted itself, he began to discover signs that
beneath all her airs and graces and foam and
froth, the old Joey endured. She was a creature
of impulse, and her vagaries were more frequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
due to the influence of the moment than any
desire to pose. She would disappoint a young
man of a long-promised <i>tête-à-tête</i> on the river, to
go and play at shop in a plantation with the
under-keeper&#39;s children. She would shed tears
over harrowing but unconvincing narratives of
destitution at the back door. She was kind to
plain girls,&mdash;which attractive girls sometimes are
not,&mdash;and servants adored her, which is a good
sign of anybody.</p>

<p class="indent">She was lavishly generous; indeed, it was never
safe for her girl friends to express admiration,
however discreet, for anything belonging to her,
for she had an embarrassing habit of tearing off
articles of attire or adornment and saying, &quot;I&#39;ll
give it to you!&quot; with the eagerness and sincerity
of a child.</p>

<p class="indent">And her code of honour was as strict as a
schoolboy&#39;s&mdash;than which no more can be said.
A secret was safe with her. She had once promptly
and permanently renounced the friendship of a
particular crony of her own, who boasted to her,
giving names and details, of a proposal of marriage
which she had recently refused.</p>

<p class="indent">In short, Miss Joan Gaymer strongly resembled
the young lady who in times long past was a certain
poetical gentleman&#39;s Only Joy. She was
sometimes forward, sometimes coy,&mdash;sometimes,
be it added, detestable,&mdash;but she never failed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
to please&mdash;or rather, to attract, which is better
still.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Jack Leroy spared neither age nor sex on
the night of the Hunt Ball. Her husband, Hughie,
and the Reverend Montague D&#39;Arcy&mdash;all suffering
from that peculiar feeling of languid depression
which invariably attacks the male sex about
9.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> when dancing is in prospect&mdash;were
hounded into pumps and white gloves, and packed
into the omnibus, which, after a drive of seven
miles, during which the gentlemen slept furtively
and the tongues of Joan and her girl friends
wagged unceasingly, deposited the entire party of
twelve on the steps of the Town Hall at Midfield.</p>

<p class="indent">Their numbers had been completed by some
overnight arrivals. The first two were Mr. and
Mrs. Lance Gaymer. Joan&#39;s only brother had
taken upon him the responsibility of matrimony
at the early age of twenty-two, and the rather
appalling young person who preceded him into
the drawing-room, and greeted Joan as &quot;Jowey,&quot;
was the accessory to the fact. Why or where
Lance had married her no one knew. He had
sprung her one day, half proudly, half defiantly,
upon a family circle at Manors which was for the
moment too horror-struck to do anything but
gape. Fortunately Uncle Jimmy was not present,&mdash;he
had departed on his voyage by this time,&mdash;and
it was left to Joan to welcome the latest addition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
to the house of Gaymer. This she did
very sensibly and prettily, though she wept unrestrainedly
upon the sympathetic bosom of Mildred
Leroy afterwards.</p>

<p class="indent">For Lance&#39;s sake Mrs. Gaymer was accepted
without demur. Whatever she was or had been,&mdash;whether
she had manipulated a beer-engine or
gesticulated in musical comedy,&mdash;there she was,
and had to be assimilated. No questions were
asked, but she was religiously invited to Manors
at intervals, and Joan and Mrs. Leroy, when they
went up to town in the season, paid occasional
state calls upon Mrs. Lance at her residence in
Maida Vale, where they drank tea in company
with the <i>alumnæ</i> of the variety stage and the jug-and-bottle
department.</p>

<p class="indent">Lance himself was understood to be making a
living out of journalism. He looked considerably
more than twenty-three.</p>

<p class="indent">The third arrival was a Mr. Guy Haliburton,
proposed for admission by Mr. Lance Gaymer,
seconded by Mrs. Lance Gaymer. He was full of
deference, and apologised with graceful humility
for his presence. He felt himself a horrible intruder,
he said, but he had been assured so earnestly
by &quot;old Lance&quot; that Mrs. Leroy was in
want of another dancing man, that he had ventured
to accept his vicarious invitation and come
to Manors. He was made welcome.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
Mr. Haliburton, on further acquaintance, described
himself as an actor, but Hughie, whose
judgments of men&mdash;as opposed to women&mdash;were
seldom wrong, put him down unhesitatingly
as a gentleman who lived, actor or no, by his wits.
He was a striking-looking personage of about
thirty. He had curly black hair and dark eyes,
with dangerous eyelashes. He was well dressed,&mdash;too
well dressed for the country,&mdash;and one
felt instinctively that he was a good card-player,
and probably objected to cold baths and early
rising.</p>

<p class="indent">The Manors party were greeted in the vestibule
of the Town Hall by Lady Fludyer, self-appointed
Mistress of the Revels. At present
she more nearly resembled a well-nourished
Niobe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear,&quot; she cried, falling limply upon Mrs.
Leroy and kissing her feverishly, &quot;what <i>do</i> you
think has happened?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Band not come?&quot; hazarded Mrs. Leroy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Worse! Not a man&mdash;not a subaltern&mdash;not
a drummerboy can get away from Ipsleigh to-night!&quot;
(Ipsleigh was a neighbouring military
<i>depôt</i>, and a fountain-head of eligibility in a
barren land.) &quot;They have all been called out
to some absurd inspection, or route-march, or
man&oelig;uvres, or something, at twenty-four hours&#39;
notice. And they were coming here in <i>swarms</i>!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
There won&#39;t be nearly enough men to go round
now. Half the girls will be against the wall all
night! Oh, my <i>dear</i>, when I get hold of the
General&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lady Fludyer&#39;s voice rose to a shriek, and she
plunged wailing into a dark doorway, like a train
entering a tunnel.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Leroy turned to her shrinking cavaliers,
with satisfaction in her eye.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s as well I brought the lot of you,&quot; she said.
&quot;Now get to work. Jack, the first waltz with
you, if you please.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The ball was soon in full swing, though it was
only too plain that men were somewhat scarce.
Hughie, much to his alarm, found his programme
full in ten minutes, and presently, bitterly regretting
the stokehold of the Orinoco, put forth
into the fray with Mrs. Lance Gaymer, having
decided to do his duty by that lady as soon as
possible, and get it over. She addressed him as
&quot;dear boy,&quot; and waltzed in a manner which
reminded him of the Covent Garden balls of
his youth, thereby causing the highest and
haughtiest of the county to inquire of their
partners who she might be. The word soon
passed round that she was the wife of young Gaymer.
(&quot;You remember, don&#39;t you? Rather an
unfortunate marriage, and all that. Barmaid, or
something. However, the family have decided to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
make the best of her. They&#39;ll have their hands
full&mdash;eh?&quot;) Whereupon fair women elevated
their discreetly powdered noses a little higher,
while unregenerate men hurried up, like the Four
Young Oysters, all eager for the treat, and furtively
petitioned Lance Gaymer to introduce
them to his wife.</p>

<p class="indent">On entering the ballroom Joan Gaymer, serenely
conscious of a perfectly-fitting new frock
and her very best tinge of colour, took up her
stand at her recognised &quot;pitch&quot; beside the end
pillar on the left under the musicians&#39; gallery,
and proceeded to fill up the vacancies caused in
her programme by the defection of the dancing
warriors from Ipsleigh. Among the first applicants
for the favour of a waltz was Mr. Guy Haliburton.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right&mdash;number two,&quot; said Joan.</p>

<p class="indent">Haliburton wrote it down, and asked for another.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll see how you waltz first,&quot; said Miss Gaymer
frankly. &quot;Then&mdash;perhaps! I am rather
particular.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The music had risen to her brain like wine, and
she was in what her admirers would have called
her most regal, and her detractors her most objectionable,
mood. Mr. Haliburton, however,
merely bowed reverentially, and made way for an
avalanche of Binkses and Cherubs, with whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
Joan, babbling at the top of her voice and enjoying
every moment of her triumph, booked a list
of fixtures that stretched away far into to-morrow
morning.</p>

<p class="indent">The waltz with the fascinating Haliburton
proved so satisfactory,&mdash;in point of fact, he was
easily the best dancer in the room,&mdash;that Joan
immediately granted him two more. It was characteristic
of her that she declined to take the floor
again until the unfortunate gentlemen at whose
expense Haliburton was being honoured had been
found, brought to her, and apprised of their fate.
They protested feebly, but Joan swept them aside
in a fashion with which they were only too familiar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Run way, chicks,&quot; she said maternally, &quot;and
get fresh partners. There are heaps of nice girls
to spare to-night. Look at that little thing over
there, with the blue eyes, and forget-me-nots in
her hair. Get introduced to her&mdash;she&#39;s perfectly
<i>lovely</i>. Worth six of me, any day. Trot!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the two young men, refusing to be comforted,
growled sulkily and elbowed their way
outside, to console each other for the fragility of
petticoat promises, and fortify themselves against
any further slings and arrows of outrageous Fortune
of a similar nature, in the refreshment room.</p>

<p class="indent">Still, the girl to whom Joan had directed their
attention was well worth notice. She stood near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
the door, a slim, graceful, and somehow rather
appealing little figure. Her hair was the colour
of ripe corn, her eyes, wide and wondering, were
as blue as the forget-me-nots in her hair, and her
lips, to quote King Solomon upon a very different
type of female, were like a thread of scarlet. She
wore a simple white frock, and carried in her hand
the bouquet of the <i>débutante</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Joan swung past her in the embrace of the ever-faithful
Binks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That child is a perfect dream,&quot; she said to
herself, &quot;but her mouth is trembling at the corners.
I wonder if some man has forgotten to ask
her to dance. I should think&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this point in her reflections she was whirled
heavily into the orbit of a reversing couple, and
the ensuing collision, together with the enjoyment
of exacting a grovelling apology from the hapless
Binks (who was in no way responsible for the accident),
drove further cogitations on the subject
of the girl with the forget-me-nots out of her head.</p>

<p class="indent">About midnight Joan slipped upstairs to what
her last partner&mdash;a mechanically-minded young
gentleman from Woolwich&mdash;described as the
repairing shop, to make good the ravages effected
by the Lancers as danced in high society in the
present year of grace.</p>

<p class="indent">The music for the next waltz was just beginning
when she returned to her pillar. No eager partner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>
awaited her, which was unusual; and Joan
glanced at her programme. She bit her lip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Number eight,&quot; she said to herself. &quot;Joey,
my child, he has scored you off&mdash;and you deserve
it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This cryptic utterance had reference to Mr.
Hugh Marrable, to whom it may be remembered
this particular dance had been offered, much as
a bone is thrown to a dog, on the lawn at Manors
three days before.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie&#39;s subsequent demeanour had piqued
his ward&#39;s curiosity. He had made no further
reference to number eight, neither had he made
any attempt during this evening to come up and
confirm the fixture. In fact, he had not asked
Joan for a dance at all, with the consequence
that Miss Gaymer, who, serenely confident that
her guardian would come and eat humble pie at
the last moment, had kept number eight free,
now found herself occupying the rather unusual
<i>rôle</i> of wallflower. What was more, she knew she
would be unable to pick up a partner, for every
available man was being worked to the last ounce,
and pretty girls still sat here and there about the
room, chatting with chaperons and maintaining
a brave appearance of enjoyment and <i>insouciance</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not going to let Hughie see me propping
a wall <i>this</i> dance,&quot; said Joan to herself with decision.
&quot;He would think I had been keeping it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>
for him. What shall I do? Go back to the cloakroom?
No; it is always full of girls without partners
pretending they&#39;ve just dropped in to get
sewn up. I&#39;ll go to the Mayor&#39;s parlour and sit
there. It&#39;s never used at these dances.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Making a mental entry on the debit side of her
missing partner&#39;s ledger, Miss Gaymer retired
unostentatiously from the ballroom, and turned
down an unlighted passage, which was blocked
by a heavy screen marked &quot;Private,&quot; and encumbered
with rolls of carpet and superfluous furniture.</p>

<p class="indent">The darkened passage was comfortably cool
and peaceful after the blaze and turmoil of the
field of action, and apparently had not been discovered
by couples in search of seclusion. Joan
was approaching the end, where she knew the
door of the Mayor&#39;s parlour was situated, when
she became aware of a certain subdued sound
quite near her. It was a sound well calculated to
catch the ear of one so tender-hearted as herself.
Some one was sobbing, very wretchedly, in the
darkness within a few feet of her.</p>

<p class="indent">Joan stopped short, a little frightened, and
peered about her. Her eyes were growing accustomed
to the gloom, and presently she beheld a
glimmer of white almost at her knee. The glimmer
outlined itself into the form of a filmy
ball-dress.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
Joan tackled the situation with her usual
promptitude.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say,&quot; she said, &quot;what&#39;s the matter? Let
me help you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sobbing ceased, and the white figure sat
up with a start.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you don&#39;t mind,&quot; continued Joan, &quot;I&#39;m
going to turn up this electric light.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a click, and the rays of a single and
rather dusty incandescent lamp illuminated the
scene, and with it the slender figure, seated forlornly
on a roll of red carpet, of the little lady of
the forget-me-nots.</p>

<p class="indent">Her face was flushed with sudden shame, for
her shoulders were still heaving, and her cheeks
glistened with tears, the which she dabbed confusedly
with a totally inadequate scrap of pocket
handkerchief.</p>

<p class="indent">Joan, regardless of her new frock, was down
upon the dusty roll of carpet in a moment. She
put her arm round the girl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear,&quot; she said authoritatively, &quot;what is
it? Tell me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl told her. It was a simple story, and
not altogether a novel one, but it contained the
elements of tragedy for all that.</p>

<p class="indent">This was her coming-out ball. She pointed to
her discarded bouquet lying on the grimy floor.
Her father had put it into her hand, and hung a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
little enamel pendant round her neck, and given
her a kiss,&mdash;she told her story with all a child&#39;s
fidelity to detail,&mdash;and had despatched her in her
brother&#39;s charge, with admonitions not to break
too many hearts, on the long fourteen-mile drive
to Midfield,&mdash;a period occupied in ecstatic anticipations
of the event to which she had been
looking forward ever since she had put her hair
up.</p>

<p class="indent">Her brother, on their arrival, had booked one
dance with her,&mdash;subsequently cancelled with
many apologies on the ground that he had just
met a girl whom he simply <i>must</i> dance with,&mdash;and
introduced her to two young men whose programmes
were already full; after which he had
plunged into the crowd, comfortably conscious
that his duty had been done, leaving his sister to
stand, smiling bravely, with tingling feet and her
heart in her throat, from half-past nine until a
quarter-past twelve. The music was pulsing in
her ears, youth and laughter were swinging easily
past her&mdash;even brushing her skirt; and she was
utterly and absolutely alone. She was just eighteen;
she was the prettiest girl (with the possible
exception of Joan Gaymer) in the room; it was
her first ball&mdash;and not a man had asked her to
dance. A small matter, perhaps, compared with
some, but men have blown out their brains for
less.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
Long before she had sobbed out all her pitiful
little narrative her head was on Joan&#39;s shoulder,
and that mercurial young person, oblivious of
everything save the fact that here was a sister in
distress, was handling the situation as if she were
twenty years her companion&#39;s senior instead of
two.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I stood it for nearly three hours,&quot; said the
girl apologetically, &quot;and then I&mdash;I came here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, my dear,&quot; said Joan with decision,
&quot;you aren&#39;t going to stay here any longer. You
are coming straight back to the ballroom with
me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t,&quot; replied the girl,&mdash;&quot;I couldn&#39;t <i>bear</i>
it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are coming back to the ballroom with
me,&quot; repeated Miss Gaymer firmly. &quot;There are
sixteen dances to go yet, and you are going to
dance the soles of your slippers through, my
child!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are awfully kind,&quot; said the girl wistfully,
&quot;but you won&#39;t be able to find me a partner now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can find you sixteen,&quot; said Joan.</p>

<p class="indent">The child turned wondering eyes on her, and
asked a question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Me? Oh, I shall have a rest: I want one,&quot;
replied Miss Gaymer, <i>splendide mendax</i>. &quot;In
fact, it will be a charity on your part to take them.
They&#39;re all stupid, and they can&#39;t dance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
But the girl shook her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re a dear to suggest it,&quot; she said, &quot;but
it wouldn&#39;t do. Think how angry they would be,
having booked a dance with Miss Gaymer, and
only getting&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know me?&quot; asked Joan in surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Everybody knows you,&quot; said the girl.</p>

<p class="indent">Joan flushed rosily. It was a compliment after
her own heart.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say, what&#39;s <i>your</i> name?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sylvia Tarrant.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Joan nodded. &quot;I know now,&quot; she said. &quot;You
live near Gainford.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Tarrants were new-comers. Sylvia&#39;s father
was a retired sailor and a widower, and had but
lately settled in the district, which would account
for his daughter&#39;s want of acquaintance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Sylvia. &quot;But really, I could not
take your partners. They&#39;d be furious at getting
me instead of you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Gaymer turned and scrutinised the face
and figure beside her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All you want, my child,&quot; she said, &quot;is a <i>start</i>.
After to-night you&#39;ll never be left alone for two
seconds at any ball you care to go to. In fact, I
don&#39;t see how I shall ever be able to get any partners
at all,&quot; she added plaintively.</p>

<p class="indent">At this idea the girl laughed and looked happier,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
which was just exactly what Joan meant her
to do. Her spirit was returning.</p>

<p class="indent">Joan rose briskly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, Sylvia,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;m going to leave
you for two minutes, because I want to find a
man to send round and tell all my partners that
you&#39;ve agreed to take them on. Then I&#39;ll come
back and get you started. Just put yourself
straight. There&#39;s a loose end of hair here: I&#39;ll
roll it up. There! Your eyes are getting better
every minute. Give your skirt a shake out, and
have a look at yourself in that mirror, and you&#39;ll
be simply perfect. So long!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s somebody coming,&quot; said Sylvia, turning
from her toilet and looking over her shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">A masculine form filled the passage. It was
Hughie, who, deprived of a partner through
Joan&#39;s absence,&mdash;the result of standing on his
dignity in the matter of number eight,&mdash;was
prowling about in search of a quiet spot where he
might indulge in the luxury of a pipe.</p>

<p class="indent">Joan, who had forgotten all about number
eight, received him with unfeigned pleasure, and
hurried him back whence he came. On the way
she breathlessly explained the situation to him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hughie, that poor child has come here not
knowing a soul, and has stood against the wall
for three hours. There isn&#39;t a partner to be had
for love or money at this hour, so she must just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span>
have mine. Take my programme&mdash;wait a minute,
I&#39;ll fill in some of these initials&mdash;and go
round to all the men whose names are on it, and
tell them I&#39;m very sorry but I&#39;ve got a headache
and can&#39;t dance any more to-night, but they&#39;re
to come to me at once at my pillar and be introduced
to a substitute I&#39;ve provided for them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you think they&#39;ll exactly&mdash;<i>jump</i> at the
idea of a substitute?&quot; suggested Hughie mildly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Their business,&quot; said Miss Gaymer with a
sudden return to her usual manner, &quot;is to do
what I tell them! Run, Hughie. Don&#39;t say a
word about the poor kid not having been able to
get partners, will you? Say she came late&mdash;anything!
You understand?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I understand,&quot; he said. &quot;She came late, and
you have a headache. Those are the two essential
facts of the case&mdash;eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Hurry!&quot; said Joan, giving her guardian
a push.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Joey,&quot; said Hughie, &quot;you&#39;re a brick!&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Half an hour later the members of the Midfield
Hunt Ball were electrified to behold Miss Joan
Gaymer sitting between two comatose and famished
chaperons, watching the dancers with indulgent
eye, and generally presenting the appearance
of one whose time for these follies is overpast.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
Then heads began to turn in another direction.
People were asking one another who the little
thing with the forget-me-nots might be, who
danced like a fairy, and appeared to have made
a &quot;corner&quot; in all Miss Gaymer&#39;s usual admirers.
Had her appearance anything to do with Miss
Gaymer&#39;s retirement? A case of pique&mdash;eh?
Heads wagged sagely, and eyebrows were elevated.
Poor Joan! Like all the great ones of the
earth, she had her detractors.</p>

<p class="indent">Sylvia herself was lost in the clouds by this
time. When not engaged in obeying Joan&#39;s mandate
to dance the soles of her slippers through,
she was granting interviews to obsequious young
men, who surged round in respectful platoons
and hoped that, though disappointed on this occasion,
they might have the pleasure at the
County Bachelors&#39; on Thursday fortnight.</p>

<p class="indent">Never was there such a triumph. The girl,
radiant and fluttering, smiled and blushed and
wrote down hopeless hieroglyphics on the back
of her programme, while Miss Joan Gaymer, the
deposed, the eclipsed, sat contentedly by and
realised to the full the truth of her own dictum
that all Sylvia Tarrant wanted was a start.</p>

<p class="indent">Later in the evening the watchful eye of Hughie
Marrable detected the fact that Joan had disappeared
from amid the concourse of matrons,
and he speculated as to where she might be. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>
himself was enjoying a brief period of freedom,
his partner for the moment having pleaded urgent
private repairs and vanished to the regions above,
and the idea had struck him that Joan might be
going supperless.</p>

<p class="indent">A brief scrutiny informed him that she was
neither in the ballroom nor the supper-room.
Then an inspiration seized him. Waiting for a
comparatively quiet moment, he paid a hasty
visit to the latter apartment, and having levied
a contribution upon the side-table, slipped furtively
round the big screen and down the dark
passage.</p>

<p class="indent">His instincts had not failed him. Miss Joan
Gaymer was sitting peacefully upon the roll of
red carpet. Her head was lying back against the
wall, and the rays of the dusty electric light
glinted upon her coppery hair. Her eyes were
closed, but she opened them at Hughie&#39;s approach,
blinking like a sleepy Dryad.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo, Hughie!&quot; she observed. &quot;You nearly
won a pair of gloves that time. Long evening,
this!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie began to deposit articles on the floor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Supper,&quot; he observed briefly.</p>

<p class="indent">He laid out a plate of mayonnaise, another of
trifle, a bottle about half-full of champagne, and
a tumbler.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hughie,&quot; said Joan, &quot;you&#39;re the only real
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span>
friend I have in the world! I was nearly <i>crying</i>
for something to eat. That, and seeing other
people dance and not me. Hughie, it was simply
awful! I had no idea: if I had sat there much
longer I should have burst into tears. I&#39;d forgotten,
too, that by giving away all my partners
I was giving away my supper. If I&#39;d remembered
I would have kept just one&mdash;a little one.
But never mind, now: the plague is stayed. I
owe you one for this. How did you manage to
carry all those things?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Large hands,&quot; said Hughie. &quot;Half a minute!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He produced from his tail-pocket two forks,
a napkin, and a bottle of soda-water.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I remembered you liked your drink diluted,&quot;
he said, pouring out both bottles at once. &quot;I
noticed it at dinner, the other night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hughie, you&#39;re a dear!&quot; said Joan impulsively.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say when!&quot; remarked Hughie unsteadily.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">It was five o&#39;clock in the morning. The band
had played &quot;Whisper and I shall hear,&quot; followed
by &quot;John Peel,&quot; followed by &quot;God save the
King,&quot; followed by &quot;John Peel,&quot; once more, followed
by &quot;God save the King&quot; again, and the
musicians were now putting away their instruments
with an air of finality which intimated that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
in their humble opinion the Midfield Hunt Ball
had had its money&#39;s worth.</p>

<p class="indent">The Manors party, all twelve of them, were
being scientifically packed into an omnibus constructed
to seat ten uncomfortably, and Joan was
waiting her turn in the portico. At this moment
Sylvia Tarrant, followed by a slightly sheepish
brother, came down the steps. Her cheeks were
excessively pink and her eyes blazed.</p>

<p class="indent">She saw Joan, and stopped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was afraid I was going to miss you,&quot; she
said. &quot;Good-night!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-night!&quot; said Joan.</p>

<p class="indent">The little girl&mdash;she was a head shorter than
Joan&mdash;placed her hands upon her new friend&#39;s
shoulders, and stood on tiptoe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should like to kiss you,&quot; she said shyly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, my dear!&quot; said Joan, quite flustered.
&quot;Of course&mdash;if you like. There!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was unusually silent all the way home, and
when they reached Manors said good-night to
Mrs. Leroy and flitted upstairs to her room. The
rest of the party dispersed ten minutes later, and
Hughie was left alone with his host and hostess.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have never known that child have a headache
before,&quot; said Mrs. Leroy rather anxiously,
as Hughie lighted her candle. &quot;I hope there&#39;s
nothing wrong.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s as right as rain,&quot; said Hughie. &quot;She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
gave up all her partners&mdash;every man Jack of
them&mdash;I mean&mdash;I&#39;m sorry! I don&#39;t think she
meant me to tell&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You may as well finish now,&quot; said Mrs.
Leroy composedly.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie did so. Mrs. Leroy nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was like her,&quot; she said softly, &quot;especially
telling you to keep quiet about it. A good many
women might have given up their dances, but
very few could have resisted the temptation to
make capital out of their generosity. Never tell
me again, miserable creature,&quot; she continued,
turning suddenly upon her comatose spouse,
&quot;that a woman is incapable of doing a good turn
to another woman!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cert&#39;nly, m&#39;dear,&quot; replied Captain Leroy,
making a desperate effort to close his mouth and
open his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But of course,&quot; broke in Hughie unexpectedly,
&quot;there are precious few women like Joey.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he bit his lip, and turned a dusky red.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Leroy, being a woman, took no outward
notice, but her husband, who was a plain creature,
turned and regarded his guest with undisguised
interest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What <i>ho</i>!&quot; he remarked, wagging his sleepy
head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-night, old man!&quot; said Hughie hurriedly.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chXIV" id="chXIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="h3">BUSINESS ONLY</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning Hughie made Miss Joan Gaymer
a proposal of marriage.</p>

<p class="indent">It was not an impressive effort&mdash;very few proposals
are. But a performance of this kind may
miss the mark as a spectacle and yet, by the indulgence
of the principal spectator, achieve its
end. Even thus Hughie failed, and for various
reasons.</p>

<p class="indent">In the first place, he proposed directly after
breakfast, which, as Joey pathetically observed
to Mrs. Leroy long afterwards, was just the sort
of brutal thing he would do. A woman, especially
if she be young, likes to be won, or at any rate
wooed, in a certain style. A secluded spot, subdued
light, mayhap a moon; if possible, distant
music&mdash;all these things tell. If Hughie had paid
a little more attention to stage-effects of this kind
he might have found his ward more amenable.
Being a Marrable, he brushed aside these trappings
and came straight to what he fondly imagined
was the point, little knowing that to a young
girl romance and courtship make up one great
and glorious vista, filling the eye and occupying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span>
the entire landscape, while marriage is a small
black cloud on the distant horizon.</p>

<p class="indent">His actual method of procedure was to sit
heavily down beside his ward as she enjoyed
the morning sun in a corner of the lawn, and
say,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Joey, I want to talk to you&mdash;on business.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right, warder,&quot; replied Miss Gaymer
meekly; &quot;fire away!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose you know,&quot; said Hughie, a little
dashed, &quot;that all your affairs have been left in
my hands?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do, worse luck!&quot; said Miss Gaymer frankly.
&quot;And that reminds me, Hughie dear, I should
like a trifle on account. You won&#39;t refuse poor
Joey, will you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She squeezed her guardian&#39;s arm in a manner
which a Frenchman would have described as <i>très
câline</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think I had better put you on an allowance,&quot;
said Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">Joan&#39;s eyes danced.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you <i>ripper</i>! How much?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can&#39;t say,&quot; replied Hughie, &quot;until I&#39;ve been
up to town and seen the bankers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When are you going?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To-morrow: that&#39;s why I wanted to talk to
you to-day. You see, your money is in two parts,
so to speak. One lot is tied up in such a way that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span>
it can&#39;t be touched until poor Uncle Jimmy&#39;s
death is actually proved.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Joan&#39;s blue-grey eyes were troubled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hughie,&quot; she said, &quot;is there <i>any</i> hope? I still
like to think so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie shook his head. &quot;Not much,&quot; he said.
&quot;In fact, none. It is known that he went with
that crack-brained expedition of Hymack&#39;s up the
Congo,&mdash;to study the Rubber Question on the
spot,&mdash;and the last letter he sent home said that
he was suffering from black-water fever, and it is
also known that the expedition came back without
him. And&mdash;all that was two years ago, Joey.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Joan nodded her head submissively.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor Uncle Jimmy!&quot; she said softly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Still,&quot; continued Hughie stoutly, &quot;you never
know. I have sent a man out to make inquiries,
and if he fails, perhaps I shall go myself. But
until we learn something definite the will can&#39;t
be proved. However, he left me very full instructions
what to do in case he did not come back, so
I must carry them out. There is plenty for you
to go on with. I shall run up to town to-morrow,
and when I come back I&#39;ll let you know how
much it is, and how much a year I can allow you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Gaymer clasped her hands and sighed
happily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We <i>will</i> have a time, Hughie!&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;ll
stand treat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Hughie gravely.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a long silence. Hughie, suddenly ill
at ease,&mdash;he had arrived at Part Two of his
morning&#39;s syllabus,&mdash;made fatuous attempts to
roll a cigarette. His ward sat with a rapt expression
in her widely-opened eyes, mentally visualising
a series of charitable enterprises (ranging
from a turquoise pendant for Mildred Leroy to
a new cap for the cook) made feasible by the
sudden prospect of wealth.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently Hughie cleared his throat in a heart-rending
manner, and said, in what he afterwards
admitted to himself was entirely the wrong sort
of voice,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Joey, I think you and I had better marry one
another.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Gaymer, who was more used to this sort
of thing than her companion, turned and eyed
him calmly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And why?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">There was only one possible answer to this
question, and Hughie should have given it with
the full strength of his heart and soul and body.
But&mdash;well, reserve is a curious and paralysing
thing. All he said was,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think it would be very suitable; don&#39;t
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For you or for me?&quot; inquired Miss Gaymer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For both of us,&quot; replied Hughie. &quot;No&mdash;for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
me!&quot; he added, his habitual modesty getting the
better of him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In what way?&quot; continued Miss Gaymer, with
unnatural calm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well&mdash;Uncle Jimmy was very keen about
it,&quot; said Hughie desperately.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re a dutiful nephew, Hughie,&quot; observed
Joan approvingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And then,&quot; continued the suitor, &quot;as I have
been made your guardian, and all that, I think
I am in a position to take care of you, and look
after your money, and so on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mean it would make it easier for you to
manage my affairs?&quot; said Miss Gaymer helpfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Hughie, feeling that he was getting
on.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Any more reasons?&quot; inquired Miss Gaymer,
with a docile appearance of intelligent interest.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie made an immense effort, and grasped
his chair until the veins stood out on his hands.
<i>Parturiunt montes</i>&mdash;at last.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Joey,&quot; he said at last, &quot;we have always
been pals, and all that. I mean, we have known
each other for a long time now, haven&#39;t we? You
even offered to marry me once,&quot;&mdash;he laughed
nervously,&mdash;&quot;when you were a kiddie. Do you
remember? It seems to me we should get on first-rate
together&mdash;eh? What&#39;s your opinion?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Ridiculus mus!</i></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span>
Miss Gaymer sat up in her chair, and turned
upon the unfortunate young man beside her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you <i>dare</i>,&quot; she said, &quot;to come to a girl
like me with a proposal like that! You sit there
and tell me that you have taken me over from
Uncle Jimmy like a&mdash;like a parcel from a porter,
and that you have been saddled with my money
and affairs, so perhaps it would be simplest and
save trouble if you married me! <i>Me!</i>&quot; she repeated,
&quot;who have to keep men off with a stick!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The last sentence was a mistake. It was an
inartistic and egotistical climax to a perfectly
justifiable tirade. Joan realised the fact the moment
she had uttered the words, but poor Hughie
was too much occupied in retiring into his shell
to notice anything. He had laid bare his heart,
in his own fashion, for the first time in his life,
and this was the result. Never again! He burned
inwardly, like a child who has been laughed at
by grown-ups.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; he said stiffly. &quot;My mistake!
Shan&#39;t occur again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Joey&#39;s ear was caught by the tone of his voice,
and conscience gave her a twinge. She patted
Hughie&#39;s arm in a friendly way.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Old boy,&quot; she said, suddenly contrite, &quot;I&#39;ve
made you angry, and I&#39;ve hurt you. I&#39;m sowwy&mdash;sorry,
I mean! (I&#39;m a bit upset, you see),&quot; she
said, smiling disarmingly. &quot;But I <i>can&#39;t</i> marry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg&nbsp;253]</span>
you, really. I couldn&#39;t <i>bear</i> to be married at all
at present. It seems so&mdash;so unnecessary. I don&#39;t
see what I should get out of it. That&#39;s a selfish
thing to say, I suppose, but I&#39;ll try to explain a
girl&#39;s point of view to you. You&#39;re a terrible child
in some respects, so I&#39;ll do it quite simply.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She stroked his sleeve in a motherly fashion,
and continued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Years ago, my dear, the only way a girl could
get her freedom or any male society was by
marrying. Now, she gets as much of both as she
wants, and if she marries she loses all the freedom
and most of the male society. So why should she
marry at all?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie kept silence before this poser. He felt
incapable of plunging into the depths of an argument:
one has to keep to the surface in discussing
these matters with a maiden of twenty.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So I shan&#39;t marry for years, if at all,&quot; continued
Miss Gaymer, with the air of one propounding
an entirely new theory. &quot;Not until
I&#39;m getting <i>passée</i> at any rate, and only then if
I could find a man whom it wouldn&#39;t give me
the creeps to think of spending the rest of my life
with. Besides, the moment one gets engaged all
the other men drop off,&mdash;all the nice ones, at
any rate,&mdash;and that would never do. Don&#39;t you
think my system is a sensible one?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It comes hard on the men,&quot; said Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span>
&quot;Yes, poor dears!&quot; said Miss Gaymer sympathetically.
&quot;Still, one man is so tiresome and a
lot is so nice!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With which concise and not unmasterly summary
of the marriage question, as viewed through
the eyes of the modern maiden, Miss Gaymer
turned the conversation into other channels, and
the idyll terminated.</p>

<p class="indent">Half an hour later they were called into the
house, to make ready for a boating expedition.</p>

<p class="indent">Joan, with her usual frankness, reverted for
a moment before they left the seclusion of the
trees to the topic that was uppermost in their
minds.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hughie,&quot; she said softly, &quot;does it hurt
much?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t quite know yet,&quot; said Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mean, are you sad or angry&mdash;which? It
usually takes a man one way or the other,&quot; observed
this experienced damsel.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know that I&#39;m either,&quot; said Hughie
meditatively; &quot;the only feeling that I have just
now is that I&#39;m desperately sorry. But I&#39;m not
kicking.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is my belief,&quot; remarked Miss Gaymer with
sudden and pardonable asperity, &quot;that you don&#39;t
care for me in the least. Do you, now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They were a very honest and sincere couple,
these. For a full minute they looked each other in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
the face, without speaking. Then Hughie said,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Joey, I simply don&#39;t know! I thought I did
half an hour ago, and I&#39;d have sworn it last night,
when&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He checked himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When what?&quot; asked Joan swiftly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing,&quot; said Hughie. &quot;That&#39;s rather beside
the point now, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Joan, curiosity struggling with honesty, nodded
reluctantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anyhow,&quot; continued Hughie, &quot;I thought I
did then, but I&#39;m blessed if I know now. In
fact,&quot; he added in a sudden burst of confidence,
&quot;sometimes I can&#39;t stand you at any price, Joey
dear!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; said Miss Gaymer, nodding a wise head,
&quot;I see you don&#39;t know your own mind yet. But
you <i>will</i>&mdash;one way or another&mdash;as soon as you
get away from me.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">A week later another interview took place
between the pair, on the same spot.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Business only this time, Joey!&quot; said Hughie,
with rather laborious cheerfulness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right. Did you have a good time in
town?&quot; inquired Miss Gaymer, in the inevitable
manner of women and Orientals, who dislike
coming to the point in matters of business without
a few decent preliminaries.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span>
&quot;Yes, thanks. I have been picking up old
friends again, and generally settling down,&quot;
said Hughie. &quot;Got a flat, and a comic man-servant&mdash;Scotchman&mdash;introduce
you some day.
He&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He plunged into a rather rambling description
of John Alexander Goble. He was evidently no
more anxious to get to business than Joan.</p>

<p class="indent">At last Miss Gaymer inquired,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Hughie, have you fixed up my affairs?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Hughie slowly. &quot;Do you want
details?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mercy, no! I don&#39;t know anything about
business, and I don&#39;t believe you do either,
Hughie. <i>Do</i> you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not much,&quot; confessed the trustee. &quot;However,
I must tell you at once, Joey, that your income
won&#39;t be nearly as large as I expected&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Right O!&quot; replied Joan cheerfully. &quot;When
do I start for the workhouse?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s not quite so bad as that,&quot; said Hughie,
&quot;but&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What am I worth?&quot; inquired the practical
Miss Gaymer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t quite tell you,&quot; said Hughie in a
hesitating fashion. &quot;You see&quot;&mdash;he appeared
to be choosing his words rather carefully&mdash;&quot;the
nominal value of investments, and their actual
cash equivalent&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
Joan put her fingers in her ears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stop!&quot; she cried, &quot;or I shall scream! I don&#39;t
know an asset from a liability, except that in the
arithmetic book brokerage is one-eighth, and&mdash;Never
mind! I should never understand. How
much am I to have a year? Tell me that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Supposing it should be a mere trifle,&quot; said
Hughie slowly, &quot;what would you do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Gaymer puckered her brow thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mean, if I hadn&#39;t enough to live on?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I shouldn&#39;t be a governess, I don&#39;t
think. I love children, but children are always
perfectly diabolical to their governess, and I
shouldn&#39;t be able to stand their mothers, either.
No: governesses are off! I shouldn&#39;t mind being
a typewriter, though, or a secretary,&mdash;not that
I can typewrite, or even spell,&mdash;provided it was
to a really nice man. An author, you know, or a
Cabinet Minister. He could walk about the room,
rumpling up his hair and getting the stuff off his
chest, and I would sit there like a little mouse,
in a neat black skirt and a white silk blouse,&mdash;<i>perhaps</i>
one or two carnations pinned on,&mdash;looking
very sweet and taking it all down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a pretty picture,&quot; said Hughie drily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, isn&#39;t it?&quot; said Miss Gaymer, with genuine
enthusiasm. &quot;I think,&quot; she continued, soaring
to still greater heights, &quot;that I should like to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg&nbsp;258]</span>
go on the stage best of all. Of course, it wouldn&#39;t
be the slightest good my going on the proper
stage&mdash;learning parts, and all that; but a piece
like &#39;The Merry Widow,&#39; with different frocks
for each act and just a few choruses to sing in,
would be top-hole! <i>Say</i> I&#39;m a pauper, Hughie!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re not&mdash;thank God!&quot; was Hughie&#39;s
brutal but earnest response.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right, then! Don&#39;t bite my head off!&quot;
said Miss Gaymer, with unimpaired good temper.
&quot;Let us resume. How much are you going to
give me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How much can you live on?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I was talking about it to Ursula Harbord&mdash;you
know her, don&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do,&quot; said Hughie, making a wry face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, don&#39;t abuse her. She&#39;s the cleverest
girl I know,&quot; said Joan warmly. &quot;She is on the
staff of &#39;The New Woman,&#39; and can put a man
in his place in about two minutes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So I discovered,&quot; said Hughie resignedly.
&quot;Popular type of girl. However, you were
saying&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was asking Ursula,&quot; continued Joan,
&quot;about the cost of living in town, and so on, and
we agreed to share a flat. She said I could get
along on three hundred a-year.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Joan paused expectantly, and waited for an
answer to her unspoken question.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span>
&quot;That,&quot; said Hughie, after hesitating a moment
as if to work out a sum in mental arithmetic,
&quot;is just what I can give you.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">A pair of Archdiaconal shoe-buckles, the glimmer
of a lady&#39;s white evening wrap, and a glowing
cigar-end were discernible in the half-light of
the verandah outside the drawing-room window
after dinner. Two Olympians, to whom human
hearts were as an open book, were discussing
mortal affairs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is there no way of bringing it off?&quot; inquired
one voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lots,&quot; replied the other. &quot;But they have so
bungled things between them that we shall have
to go slow for a bit. Why, oh, why do men whom
you could trust to do almost <i>anything</i> in the
ordinary way always make such a mess of their
love-affairs? Why aren&#39;t <i>you</i> married, for instance,
Mr. D&#39;Arcy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To return to the point,&quot; said the reverend
gentleman evasively, &quot;what ought Hughie to do?
Take her by the shoulders and shake her? I have
known such a method prove most efficacious,&quot; he
added, rather incautiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;N-no,&quot; said Mrs. Leroy, &quot;I don&#39;t think so&mdash;not
in Joey&#39;s case. It would bring some women
to reason&mdash;most women, in fact&mdash;in no time.
But the child is too high-spirited. Her pride
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span>
would never forgive such treatment. A better
way would be for him to make love to some one
else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Being Hughie, that is out of the question.
He could only make love to some one else if he
meant it; and that would rather defeat your
object, Mrs. Leroy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>My</i> object?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, ours, then. But is there no other way?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. He must get into trouble of some kind.
At present he is too popular: everybody likes
him. If they turned against him she would come
round fast enough. Yes, he must get into <i>trouble</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, perhaps he will,&quot; said the Venerable
the Archdeacon hopefully.</p>

<p class="h3">DEPUTATIONS&mdash;WITH A DIFFERENCE</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Hughie</span> let himself into his chambers in Jermyn
Street, and rang the bell of his sitting-room.
It was a comfortable bachelor apartment, with
sporting trophies on the walls, cavernous arm-chairs
round the fireplace, and plenty of pipes
dotted about the mantelpiece.</p>

<p class="indent">It was eleven o&#39;clock on a fine morning in
March, and Hughie had been to Putney to stroke
a scratch eight against the Cambridge crew, who
had rowed a full trial on the early flood and
required a little pacing between bridges.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently the sitting-room door opened, and
John Alexander Goble presented himself upon
the threshold. Since his unregenerate days on
board the Orinoco a new and awful respectability
had descended upon him, and in his sober menial
attire he looked more like a Calvinistic divine
than ever. He regarded his employer with some
displeasure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your breakfast has been sitting in the fender
these twa hours,&quot; he observed bitterly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sorry, John. Afraid I forgot to countermand
it. I had some at Putney.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg&nbsp;264]</span>
&quot;At what hour?&quot; inquired the inexorable Mr.
Goble.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Half-past seven, about, with the crew.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s eleven the noo. You&#39;ll be able for some
mair, I doot. Forbye it&#39;s a pity to waste good
food. Bide you, while I&#39;ll get it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie, who was as wax in the hands of his
retainer, presently found himself partaking of a
lukewarm collation and opening his letters.</p>

<p class="indent">He glanced through the first.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;John!&quot; he called.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Goble appeared from the bedroom.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Were you cryin&#39; on me?&quot; he inquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Did two gentlemen call here at ten?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aye.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who were they?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yon felly Gaymer, and anither.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who was he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I couldna say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What was he like?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Goble cast about him for a suitable comparison.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was just a long drink o&#39; watter,&quot; he announced
at last, with an air of finality.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did he look&mdash;like an actor?&quot; inquired
Hughie, with a flash of intuition.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Worse than that,&quot; replied Goble.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Um&mdash;I think I know him. Thank you, that
will do. By the way, I&#39;m expecting some friends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[pg&nbsp;265]</span>
to lunch. Captain and Mrs. Leroy&mdash;and Mr.
D&#39;Arcy. You know him, don&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;D&#39;Arcy? Aye, I mind him fine. A fat yin,
wi&#39; a lum hat tied up wi&#39; string. A popish-lookin&#39;
body,&quot; commented Mr. Goble sorrowfully.</p>

<p class="indent">He retired downstairs, to ponder upon the
dubiety of the company into which his employer
appeared to be drifting, and Hughie returned to
his letters.</p>

<p class="indent">The sight of the next caused him to glow suddenly,
for on the back of the envelope he observed
the address of Joan&#39;s flat. But he cooled when he
turned it round and read the superscription. It
was in the handwriting of the lady with whom
Joan shared the flat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Marrable</span> [it said],&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Joan and I are coming to call on you to-morrow
about twelve&mdash;&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;They&#39;d better stay to lunch.&quot; Hughie touched
the bell and continued,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;Dear Joan is very young in some ways, and
she has no idea of the value of money; but since
talking the matter over with <i>me</i> recently, she
would like to have a few words with you about
her financial position.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How delightful to see the leaves coming out
again!&mdash;Believe me, yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="right">&quot;<span class="smcap">Ursula Harbord</span>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg&nbsp;266]</span>
&quot;&#39;Dear Joan would like&#39;&mdash;<i>would</i> she?&quot; commented
Hughie. &quot;I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s Ursula Harbord
I&#39;m going to have the few words with, though.
Hades!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He rose and crossed the room to the fireplace,
where he kicked the coals with unnecessary
violence. Then he sighed heavily, and picked up
a photograph which stood upon the mantelpiece.</p>

<p class="indent">Joan had spoken nothing but the truth when
she told Hughie that he would discover his true
feelings as soon as he found himself away from
her. For six or eight months he had gone about
his day&#39;s work with the thoroughness and determination
of his nature. He had administered the
little estate of Manors, was beginning to dabble
in politics, had taken up rowing again, and was
trying to interest himself generally in the course
of life to which he had looked forward so eagerly
on his travels. He had even tried conclusions
with a few <i>débutantes</i> who had been introduced to
his notice by business-like Mammas. But whatever
his course of life, his thoughts and desires
persisted in centring round a single object,&mdash;a
very disturbing and elusive object,&mdash;and try as
he would, he failed to derive either pleasure or
profit from his present existence.</p>

<p class="indent">In other words, he had made a mess of a love-affair.</p>

<p class="indent">Most men&mdash;and most women too, for that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg&nbsp;267]</span>
matter&mdash;undergo this experience at least once in
their lives, and no two ever endure it in the same
way. One rants, another mopes, a third forgets,
a fourth bides his time, a fifth seeks consolation
elsewhere, a sixth buries himself in work or
dissipation. Hughie, who cherished a theory that
everything ultimately comes right in this world
provided you hold on long enough, and that
when in doubt a man should &quot;stand by the Day&#39;s
Work and await instructions,&quot; like Kipling&#39;s
Bridge-Builders, had gone steadily on, because it
was his nature so to do. It was uphill work at
present,&mdash;a mechanical perfunctory business,
with no reward or alleviation in sight,&mdash;but he
was determined to go on doing his duty by Joan
to the best of his ability, and combine so far as he
was able the incompatible <i>rôles</i> of stern guardian,
undesired suitor, and&mdash;to him most paradoxical
of all&mdash;familiar friend.</p>

<p class="indent">For there was no doubt that Joan liked him.
She trusted him, consulted him,&mdash;yea, obeyed
him, even when he contradicted her most preposterous
utterances and put down a heavy foot on
her most cherished enterprises. For this he did
without flinching. The fact that he was a failure
as a lover seemed to be no reason why he should
fail as a guardian.</p>

<p class="indent">Not that Joan submitted readily to his <i>régime</i>.
To Hughie&#39;s essentially masculine mind her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[pg&nbsp;268]</span>
changes of attitude were a complete mystery.
They seemed to have no logical sequence or connection.
She would avoid him or seek him out
with equal unexpectedness. She might be hopelessly
obstinate or disarmingly docile. One day
she would behave like a spoilt child; on another
she would be a very grandmother to him. Sometimes
she would blaze up and rail against her
much-enduring guardian for a tyrant and a
monster; at others she would take him under a
most maternal wing, and steer him through a
garden-party or a reception in a manner which
made him feel like a lost child in the hands of a
benevolent policeman. On one occasion, which
he particularly remembered, she had rounded on
him and scolded him for a full half-hour for his
stolid immobility and lack of <i>finesse</i>; the self-same
afternoon he had overheard her hotly defending
him against a charge of dulness brought by two
frivolous damsels over the tea-table.</p>

<p class="indent">All this was very perplexing to a man who
hated subtlety and liked his friends and foes
marked in plain figures. It unsettled his own
opinions, too. Joey&#39;s variegated behaviour prevented
him from deciding in his own mind
whether he really liked her or not. At present
all he was certain of was that he loved her.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile she was coming to see him&mdash;about
her financial position. That did not promise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg&nbsp;269]</span>
romance. And Ursula Harbord was coming too.
Help! Certainly life was a rotten business at
present. And it had been so full and glorious
before he had forsaken the wide world and taken
to this sort of thing. It might have been so different
too, if only&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">Poor Hughie replaced Joan&#39;s photograph,
sighed again&mdash;and coughed confusedly. A funereal
image appeared over his shoulder in the
chimney-glass.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Were you ringin&#39;?&quot; inquired a sepulchral
voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, John. Miss Gaymer and a friend of hers
are coming to see me this morning. They&#39;ll probably
stay to lunch. You can clear away that food
over there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He returned to his letters. Only one remained
unopened, and proved to be from a man with
whom he had arranged to shoot in the autumn.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This seems to promise a little relief from the
present cheery state of affairs,&quot; he mused. &quot;Four
men on a nice bleak moor, with no women about!
Thank God! A hundred pounds a share. Well,
Lord knows, trusteeing is an unprofitable business,
but I think I can just do it. I&#39;ll accept at
once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He began to write a telegram. Bachelors have
a habit of conducting their correspondence in this
manner.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
&quot;Here&#39;s they twa whigmalearies,&quot; announced
Mr. Goble dispassionately.</p>

<p class="indent">He ushered in Lance Gaymer and the histrionic
Mr. Haliburton.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;After compliments,&quot; as they say in official
circles, Lance came to the point.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Marrable,&quot; he said, after an almost imperceptible
exchange of glances with Haliburton,
&quot;aren&#39;t you keeping my sister rather short of
money?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie turned and stared at him in blank
astonishment.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Haliburton, exuding gentlemanly tact at
every pore, rose instantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You two fellows would like to be alone, no
doubt,&quot; he said. &quot;I must not intrude into family
matters. I&#39;ll call for you in half an hour, Lance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie had risen too.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You need not trouble, Mr. Haliburton,&quot; he
said. &quot;Lance is coming with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Gaymer was obviously unprepared for such
prompt measures as these.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But look here&mdash;I say&mdash;what the devil do
you mean?&quot; he spluttered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mean,&quot; replied Hughie deliberately,&mdash;he
had realised, almost exultantly, that here once
more was a situation which need not be handled
with kid gloves,&mdash;&quot;that I am your sister&#39;s sole
trustee and guardian, and that you have nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[pg&nbsp;271]</span>
whatever to do with the disposition of her property,
and&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think you forget,&quot; said Lance truculently,
&quot;that I am her brother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not forget it,&quot; said Hughie. &quot;Neither
did Jimmy Marrable. It was no oversight on his
part which left Joan&#39;s inheritance and yours
locked up in separate compartments, so to speak.
He gave you an independent income long ago,
Lance, because he was particularly anxious to
give you no opportunity of interfering with Joan&#39;s
affairs when the time came. For some reason
he had chosen me for the job, and he preferred
that I should have a free hand. Therefore I am
not going to allow you to cut into my department.
I am sorry to have to put it so brutally, but,
really, you have been infernally officious of late.
This is the fourth reference which you have made
to the subject during the past six weeks. I don&#39;t
know whether your enterprise is inspired by
brotherly love or the desire to make a bit, but
whichever it is I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll get much
change out of me. I also object to your latest
move&mdash;bringing in Mr. Haliburton, presumably
as an accomplice, or a witness, or whatever you
like to call him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Really, Mr. Marrable!&quot; Mr. Haliburton&#39;s
voice quivered with gentlemanly indignation.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie rang the bell.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg&nbsp;272]</span>
&quot;Look here, Marrable,&quot; burst out Lance furiously,
&quot;you are getting yourself in a hole, I can
tell you! We&mdash;I happen to know that Jimmy
Marrable left thirty or forty thousand pounds
at least for Joey&#39;s immediate use; and I am
pretty certain he left something for mine too.
Now&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t ask you to stay to lunch,&quot;
said Hughie, &quot;but I have some friends coming.
Show these gentlemen out, John.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The deputation was ruthlessly shepherded
downstairs by the impassive Mr. Goble, and
Hughie was left to his own reflections. He filled
a pipe meditatively.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder,&quot; he said, lighting a spill and puffing,
&quot;where young Lance got his figures from. I
also wonder what the game is. He was obviously
a bit worked up, and I should say he had
been fortifying himself for the interview before
he arrived. I knew, of course, that he had never
forgiven me for being put in charge of Joey&#39;s
affairs: he has always made things as difficult
for me as possible. Perhaps he wants a trifle for
himself: his closing remarks rather pointed that
way. But what on earth is friend Haliburton
doing in that galley? I fancy he has been at the
back of things all along. What interest has <i>he</i> in
the amount of Joey&#39;s fortune? I don&#39;t know
much about him, but I wouldn&#39;t trust him a yard.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg&nbsp;273]</span>
Perhaps Lance owes him money. Have they
gone, John?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aye,&quot; replied Mr. Goble. &quot;They went quite
quietly,&quot; he added regretfully.</p>

<p class="indent">He began to lay the table for luncheon.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say, John,&quot; began Hughie awkwardly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aye?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s a thing I want to speak to you about.
I have been losing money lately, and I have to
give up some luxuries I can&#39;t afford. I&mdash;I am
afraid you are one of them. I have always regarded
a man-servant as an extravagance,&quot; he
went on with a rush, &quot;and I must ask you to
look about for another place. Take your time,
of course, and don&#39;t leave me till you are suited.
I shall be glad to give you a character, and all
that. You understand?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a silence, while Mr. Goble folded a
napkin. Then he replied: &quot;Fine!&quot; Then he
added, after a pause, &quot;So you&#39;ve been lossin&#39;
your money? Aye! Aha! Mphm!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. I&#39;m desperately sorry,&quot; said Hughie
penitently. &quot;I don&#39;t want to lose you. Perhaps
it will only be tempor&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ll no be daen&#39; that yet a while,&quot; remarked
Mr. Goble morosely. &quot;I&#39;m an ill body
tae move.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, John, you don&#39;t understand. I can&#39;t
afford to keep you for more than&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg&nbsp;274]</span>
&quot;There a cab!&quot; observed Mr. Goble.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie looked down out of the window.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So it is,&quot; he said hastily. &quot;I&#39;ll show them up,
John. You go on with your work.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was across and out of the room in three
strides, and could be heard descending the stairs
kangaroo fashion.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. John Goble breathed heavily into a spoon
and rubbed it with the point of his elbow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wunner wha his visitors is,&quot; he mused caustically.
&quot;Of course he always opens the door
himsel&#39; tae all his visitors! Of course I dinna ken
wha she is! Oh, no!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He wagged his head in a broken-hearted manner,
and gave vent to a depressing sound which a
brother Scot would have recognised as a chuckle
of intense amusement.</p>

<p class="indent">To him entered Miss Ursula Harbord. She
wore <i>pince-nez</i> and a sage-green costume of some
art fabric&mdash;one of the numerous crimes committed
in the name of Liberty. She was Joan
Gaymer&#39;s latest fad; and under her persuasive
tutelage Joan was beginning to learn that the men
who all her life had served her slightest whim were
at once monsters of duplicity and brainless idiots;
and that, given a few more fervid and ungrammatical
articles in &quot;The New Woman,&quot; women
would shortly come to their own and march in
the van of civilisation, and that people like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span>
Ursula Harbord would march in the van of the
women.</p>

<p class="indent">Pending this glorious destiny, Miss Harbord
acted as unsettler-in-general of Joan&#39;s domestic
instincts, and worried Hughie considerably.</p>

<p class="indent">She was followed into the room by Joan; very
much the Joan of last summer, if we make allowances
for the distressing appearance presented by
a young woman of considerable personal attractions
who is compelled by Fashion&#39;s decree, for
this season at any rate, to obscure her features
under a hat which looks like an unsuccessful
compromise between a waste-paper basket and a
dish-cover.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, John,&quot; she inquired in her friendly fashion,
&quot;have you quite settled down in London?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aye, mem.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not missing Scotland?&quot; continued Joan,
peeling off her white gloves and sitting down in an
arm-chair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Naething to speak of,&quot; said John.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought,&quot; continued Miss Gaymer, surveying
Mr. Goble&#39;s Cimmerian features, &quot;that you
had perhaps left your heart there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ma hairt? What for would I dae a thing like
that?&quot; enquired the literal Mr. Goble. &quot;A hairt
is no a thing a body can dae wi&#39;oot,&quot; he explained.
&quot;It&#39;s no like a rib. Ye jist get the ane, so ye
canna afford tae get leavin&#39; it ony place.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg&nbsp;276]</span>
Miss Gaymer smilingly abandoned the topic,
and in all probability the ghost of Sydney Smith
chuckled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When are you going to pay us another visit
at Manors?&quot; was Joan&#39;s next question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m no sure,&quot; said Mr. Goble. &quot;Mr. Marrable
has jist given me notice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, John!&quot; said Joan, &quot;what have you been
doing? Breaking his china?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Drinking his wine?&quot; suggested Miss Harbord,
turning from a scornful inspection of Hughie&#39;s
stock of current literature.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I doot I&#39;m no givin&#39; satisfaction,&quot; said
John.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, John, I am <i>sure</i> you are!&quot; said Joan.
&quot;Was that the reason he gave?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He said he was givin&#39; up keepin&#39; a man-servant.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Harbord, who had been craning her neck
to see something in the street, turned round
sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why? Has he been losing money?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I couldna say, mem,&quot; said Mr. Goble woodenly.
He shared his master&#39;s antipathy to Miss
Harbord.</p>

<p class="indent">That lady shook her head resignedly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought so!&quot; she said. &quot;Joan, dear&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this moment Hughie entered, and Miss Harbord&#39;s
fire was diverted.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg&nbsp;277]</span>
&quot;Mr. Marrable, have you got rid of that cabman?&quot;
she enquired with truculence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rather!&quot; said Hughie. &quot;He went like a
lamb.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was intoxicated,&quot; remarked Miss Harbord
freezingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t notice it,&quot; said Hughie. &quot;He was
quite tractable. Apparently you engaged him at
Hyde Park Terrace and stopped at two shops on
the way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is correct.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you gave him one and threepence for a
drive of over two miles and a stop of about ten
minutes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;His legal fare. We employed him for exactly
half an hour.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But did you tell him that you were engaging
him by the hour?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course not! They simply <i>crawl</i> if you do.
You might have known that, Mr. Marrable.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, it&#39;s all right now,&quot; interposed Joan
cheerfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Marrable,&quot; persisted Miss Harbord, &quot;I
fear you were weak with him. How much did you
give him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing out of the way,&quot; said Hughie uneasily.
&quot;You&#39;ll stay to lunch, won&#39;t you? I am
expecting the Leroys and D&#39;Arcy. We can all go
on to a <i>matinée</i> afterwards.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg&nbsp;278]</span>
Miss Harbord assumed the expression of one
who is not to be won over by fair words, and
endeavoured to catch Miss Gaymer&#39;s eye&mdash;an
enterprise which failed signally, as the latter
lady rose from her seat and strolled to the
window.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Marrable,&quot; began Miss Harbord, taking
up her parable single-handed, &quot;Joan wishes to
have a chat with you about money-matters.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No I don&#39;t, Hughie,&quot; said Miss Gaymer
promptly, over her shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well then, dear,&quot; said Miss Harbord calmly,
&quot;you ought to. Women leave these things to
men far too much as it is. Joan has an old-fashioned
notion,&quot; she added to Hughie, &quot;that
it is not quite nice for girls to know anything
about money-matters: hence her reluctance.
However, I will conduct her case for her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Harbord crossed her legs, threw herself
back in her chair in a manner which demonstrated
most conclusively her contempt for appearances
and feminine ideas of decorum, and
began:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me, Mr. Marrable, what interest does
Joan get on her money?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie gaped feebly. Half an hour ago he
had put Mr. Lance Gaymer to the door for an
almost precisely similar question. But Lance
Gaymer was a man, and Miss Harbord, conceal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg&nbsp;279]</span>
the fact as she might, was a woman; and Hughie&#39;s
old helplessness paralysed him once more.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The usual rate of interest,&quot; he said lamely,
&quot;is about four per cent.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ursula Harbord nodded her head, as who
should say, &quot;I expected that!&quot; and produced a
crumpled newspaper from her muff.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That,&quot; she said almost indulgently, &quot;reveals
your ignorance of the world, Mr. Marrable. If
you mixed a little more in affairs, and followed
some regular occupation, you would have more
opportunities of discovering things for yourself,
and so be spared the indignity&mdash;I suppose you
consider it an indignity?&mdash;of having to be advised
by a woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The afflicted Hughie murmured something
about it being a pleasure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now here,&quot; continued Miss Harbord, slapping
the newspaper as an East-End butcher slaps
the last beef-steak at his Saturday night auction,
&quot;I have the report of the half-yearly meeting
of the International Trading Company, Limited,
where a dividend of seven per cent was declared,
making a dividend on the whole year of fourteen
per cent. <i>Now</i> do you see what I&mdash;what Joan
wants?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hughie,&quot; said Joan, who was making a tour
of inspection of the room, &quot;where did you get this
lovely leopard-skin? Have I seen it before?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg&nbsp;280]</span>
&quot;Shot it, Joey. I beg your pardon, Miss Harbord?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you see what Joan wants you to do?&quot;
repeated that financial Amazon.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Afraid I don&#39;t, quite. I&#39;ll get on to it in a
minute, though,&quot; replied the docile Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Surely, the whole thing is quite clear! You
must take Joan&#39;s capital out of whatever it is
in and buy shares in The International Trading
Company with it. And be sure you order <i>preference</i>
shares, Mr. Marrable. They are the best
sort to get. That is all; but I ought not to have
to point these things out to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie surveyed his preceptress in an undecided
fashion. Was it worth while endeavouring
to explain to her a few of the first principles
of finance, or would it be simpler to grin and
bear it? He decided on the latter alternative.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The shares,&quot; continued Miss Harbord, having
evidently decided to follow up her whips
with a few selected scorpions, &quot;should be bought
as cheap as possible. They go up and down, you
know, like&mdash;a&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monkey on a stick?&quot; suggested Hughie, with
the air of one anxious to help.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Harbord smiled indulgently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no! Like a&mdash;a barometer, let us say;
and you have to watch your opportunity. There
is a thing called &#39;par&#39; which they go to,&mdash;anybody
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg&nbsp;281]</span>
will tell you what it is,&mdash;and that is a very
good time to buy them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie, fighting for breath, rose and joined
Joan in the window recess, while Miss Harbord,
with much ostentatious crackling, folded up the
newspaper and put it away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hughie,&quot; said Joan, under cover of the noise,
&quot;you are angry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not at all,&quot; replied Hughie, wiping his eyes
furtively. &quot;A bit flummoxed&mdash;that&#39;s all. No
idea your friend was so up in these things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She <i>is</i> clever, isn&#39;t she?&quot; said Joan, with unaffected
sincerity. &quot;But, Hughie dear, don&#39;t
bother about it if it worries you. My affairs must
be a fearful nuisance to you, but Ursula was so
keen that I should come&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m glad you did, Joey. It was worth it,&quot;
said Hughie simply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course,&quot; continued the unlearned Miss
Gaymer, &quot;to people like Ursula these things are
as easy as falling off a log, but for you and me,
who know nothing about business, they&#39;re pretty
stiff to tackle, aren&#39;t they?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite so,&quot; agreed Hughie meekly. &quot;But look
here, Joey,&quot; he continued, &quot;are you really in
want of money?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course she is!&quot; said Miss Harbord, overhearing
and resuming the offensive.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I <i>could</i> do with a few more frocks, Hughie,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg&nbsp;282]</span>
said Miss Gaymer wistfully, &quot;if it wouldn&#39;t be
a bother to change those investments about a bit,
as Ursula advises. Still, if it can&#39;t be done, we&#39;ll
say no more about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will another hundred a-year be any use to
you?&quot; said Hughie suddenly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Hughie, I should <i>think</i> so! Can it be
managed without a fearful upset?&quot; cried Miss
Gaymer, her eyes already brightening over a
vista of blouse-lengths and double-widths.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Hughie shortly. &quot;I&#39;ll&mdash;I&#39;ll make
the necessary changes and see that the cash is
paid into your banking account.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You dear!&quot; said Miss Gaymer, with sincerity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A hundred pounds? It might be more!&quot;
observed the daughter of the horse-leech on the
sofa. Fourteen per cent still rankled in her
Napoleonic brain.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie crossed to the writing-table and tore
up a telegraph-form.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Capt&#39;n Leroy!&quot; announced Mr. Goble&#39;s
voice in the doorway.</p>

<p class="indent">That easy-going paladin entered the room,
and intimated that his wife had sent him along
to say that she would arrive in ten minutes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That means twenty,&quot; said Joan. &quot;Ursula,
we have just time to run round and see that hat
we thought we&#39;d better not decide about until
we had heard from Hughie about the thing we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg&nbsp;283]</span>
came to see him about. Now I can try it on with
a clear conscience. Back directly, Hughie!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She flitted out, the prospective hundred pounds
obviously burning a hole in her pocket (or wherever
woman in the present era of fashion keeps
her money), followed by Miss Harbord.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie turned to Leroy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take a cigarette, old man,&quot; he said, &quot;and sit
down with a glass of sherry while I do myself up
for lunch. Been down at Putney.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Leroy obeyed. When Hughie returned from
his bedroom a quarter of an hour later, he found
that Mrs. Leroy had arrived. She and her husband
were engaged in a low-toned conversation,
which they broke off rather abruptly on their
host&#39;s entrance.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie shook hands, and sweeping some newspapers
off the sofa, offered his latest-arrived
guest a seat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, thanks, Hughie,&quot; said Mrs. Leroy; &quot;I
prefer to look out of the window.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She walked across the room and began to gaze
down into the street with her back to Hughie.
Her husband, evidently struck with the suitability
of this attitude, rose and joined her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The fact is, Hughie,&quot; began Mrs. Leroy, staring
resolutely at the house opposite, &quot;Jack and I
want to talk to you like a father and mother, and
I can do it more easily if I look the other way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg&nbsp;284]</span>
&quot;Same here,&quot; corroborated Leroy gruffly.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie started, and surveyed the guilty-looking
pair of backs before him with an uneasy suspicion.
Surely he was not going to be treated to a third
variation on the same theme!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go on, Jack!&quot; was Mrs. Leroy&#39;s next remark.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can&#39;t be done, m&#39;dear,&quot; replied the gentleman,
after an obvious effort.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Hughie,&quot; continued Mrs. Leroy briskly,
&quot;as this coward has failed me, I must say it
myself. I want to tell you that people are talking.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ursula Harbord, for instance,&quot; said Hughie
drily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. How did you know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She delivered a lecture to me this morning.
Gave me to understand that she darkly suspects
me of being a knave, and made no attempt to
conceal her conviction that I am a fool.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, of course that&#39;s all nonsense,&quot; said Mrs.
Leroy to a fly on the window-pane; &quot;but really,
Hughie, with all the money that her Uncle
Jimmy left her, you ought to be able to give Joey
more than you do, <i>shouldn&#39;t</i> you? The child has
to live in quite a small way&mdash;not really poor,
you know, but hardly as an heiress ought to live.
You give her surprisingly small interest on her
money, Jack says&mdash;didn&#39;t you, Jack?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg&nbsp;285]</span>
Captain Leroy made no reply, but the deep
shade of carmine on the back of his neck said
&quot;Sneak!&quot; as plainly as possible.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you know he would be the last to say
anything against you&mdash;wouldn&#39;t you, Jack?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rather!&quot; said Leroy, in a voice of thunder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hughie,&quot; said Mrs. Leroy, turning impulsively,
&quot;won&#39;t you confide in me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie kicked a coal in the grate in his usual
fashion, and sighed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t, <i>really</i>,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fact is, old man,&quot; broke in Leroy, in response
to his wife&#39;s appealing glances, &quot;we didn&#39;t want
to say anything at all, but the missis thought it
best&mdash;considerin&#39; the way people are talkin&#39;,
and all that. Can <i>I</i> be of any use? Been speculatin&#39;,
or anything?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Jack, I haven&#39;t,&quot; said Hughie shortly.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Leroy gave a helpless look at her husband,
and said desperately:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Hughie, we can&#39;t leave things like this!
You simply don&#39;t <i>know</i> what stories are going
about. It is ruining your chances with Joey, too.
She thinks you are a noodle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know it,&quot; said Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, look here,&quot; said Leroy, &quot;can&#39;t you give
us some sort of explanation&mdash;some yarn we
could put about the place to account for this
state of things&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg&nbsp;286]</span>
&quot;What state of things?&quot; said Hughie doggedly.
He was in an unpleasant temper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Hughie,&quot; said Mrs. Leroy, keeping hers,
&quot;here is Joan, known to have been left a lot of
money for her immediate use,&mdash;she admits it
herself,&mdash;living quite humbly and cheaply, and
obviously not well off. People are asking why.
There are two explanations given. One, the more
popular, is that you have embezzled or speculated
the money all away. The other, which prevails
among the <i>élite</i>&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The people who are really in the know, you
know,&quot; explained Leroy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes: <i>they</i> say,&quot; continued his wife, &quot;that
Joan won&#39;t marry you, so you have retaliated
by&mdash;by&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By cutting off supplies,&quot; suggested Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, until&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Until she is starved into submission&mdash;eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s about the size of it, old son,&quot; said
Leroy.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a long pause. Finally Hughie
said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, it&#39;s a pretty story; but, honestly, I&#39;m
not in a position to contradict it at present.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Leroy desisted from plaiting the window-cord,
swung round, walked deliberately to the
fireplace, and laid a hand on Hughie&#39;s arm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hughie,&quot; she said, in tones which her husband
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[pg&nbsp;287]</span>
subsequently affirmed would have drawn
ducks off a pond, &quot;what have you done? Tell
<i>us</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Leroy followed his wife across the room. &quot;Get
it off your chest, old man,&quot; he said, with the air
of a father confessor.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie smiled gratefully. He took Mrs. Leroy&#39;s
two hands into one of his own, and laid the
other on Jack Leroy&#39;s shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jack and Milly,&quot; he said earnestly, &quot;my two
pals!&mdash;I would rather tell you than anybody else;
but&mdash;I simply <i>can&#39;t</i>! It&#39;s not my secret! You&#39;ll
probably find out all about it some day. At present
I must ask you to accept my assurance that
I&#39;m not so black as I&#39;m painted.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hughie,&quot; said Mrs. Leroy, &quot;you are simply
stupid! We have not come to you out of idle
curiosity&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know that,&quot; said Hughie heartily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I think you might give us some sort of
an inkling&mdash;a sort of favourable bulletin&mdash;that
I could pass on to Joey, at any rate&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Joey!&quot; said Hughie involuntarily; &quot;Lord
forbid!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Leroy, startled by the vehemence of his
tone, paused; and her husband added dejectedly,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right, old man! Let&#39;s drop it! Sorry you
couldn&#39;t see your way to confide in us. Wouldn&#39;t
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg&nbsp;288]</span>
have gone any further. Rather sick about the
whole business&mdash;eh? No wonder! Money is
the devil, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Somehow Leroy&#39;s words hit Hughie harder
than anything that had been said yet. He wavered.
After all,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ve bought the hat, and I&#39;m perfectly
<i>ravenous</i>,&quot; announced Joan, appearing in the
doorway. &quot;And we&#39;ve brought Mr. D&#39;Arcy.
Hughie, are those plover&#39;s eggs? Ooh!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This was no atmosphere for the breathing of
confidential secrets. The party resumed its usual
demeanour of off-hand British <i>insouciance</i>, and
began to gather round the luncheon-table. Only
Mr. D&#39;Arcy&#39;s right eyebrow asked a question of
Mrs. Leroy, which was answered by a slight but
regretful shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie&#39;s apartment was L-shaped, and the
feast was spread in the smaller arm, out of the
way of draughts and doorways. Consequently
any one entering the room would fail to see the
luncheon table unless he turned to his left and
walked round a corner.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie was helping the plover&#39;s eggs,&mdash;it is
to be feared that Miss Gaymer received a Benjamin&#39;s
portion of the same,&mdash;when Mr. Goble
suddenly appeared at his elbow and whispered
in his ear,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Him again!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg&nbsp;289]</span>
Muttering an apology, Hughie left the table
and walked round the corner to the other arm of
the room. Lance Gaymer had just entered. His
face was flushed and his eyes glittered, and
Hughie&#39;s half-uttered invitation to him to come
in and have some lunch died away upon his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo, Lance!&quot; he said lamely.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Gaymer replied, in the deliberate and portentously
solemn tones of a man who is three
parts drunk,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I understand you have got a party on here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Hughie, endeavouring to edge his
visitor through the doorway.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What I want to say,&quot; continued Mr. Gaymer
in rising tones, &quot;is that I accuse you of embezzling
my sister&#39;s property, and I&#39;m going to make
things damned hot for you. Yes&mdash;<i>you</i>! Go and
tell that to your luncheon-party round the corner!&quot;
he concluded with a snort. &quot;And&mdash;glug&mdash;glug-glug!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">By this time he had been judiciously backed
into the passage, almost out of ear-shot of those
in the room. Simultaneously Mr. Goble&#39;s large
hand closed upon his mouth from behind, and
having thus acquired a good purchase, turned
its owner deftly round and conducted him downstairs.</p>

<p class="indent">Death-like silence reigned at the luncheon-table.
Hughie wondered how much they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[pg&nbsp;290]</span>
heard. Not that it mattered greatly, for Master
Lance&#39;s accusations, making allowances for alcoholic
directness, partook very largely of the nature
of those already levelled at Hughie by more conventional
deputations.</p>

<p class="indent">Before returning to his seat, Hughie crossed
to the window and looked down into the street.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Lance Gaymer was being assisted into a
waiting hansom by the kindly hands of Mr. Guy
Haliburton.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie, having seen all he expected to see,
returned with faltering steps to his duties as a
host.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a delicate moment, calling for the exercise
of much tact. Even Mildred Leroy hesitated.
Joan had flushed red, whether with shame, or
anger, or sympathy, it was hard to say. Mr.
D&#39;Arcy regarded her curiously.</p>

<p class="indent">But heavy-footed husbands sometimes rush in,
with success, where the most wary and diplomatic
wives fear to tread. Jack Leroy cleared his
throat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, Hughie, my son,&quot; he observed, &quot;when
you&#39;ve <i>quite</i> done interviewin&#39; all your pals on the
door-mat, perhaps you&#39;ll give your guests a
chance. With so many old friends collected round
your table like this, we want to drink your health,
young-fellow-my-lad! Fill up your glass, Miss
Harbord! No heel-taps, Milly!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg&nbsp;291]</span>
There was an irrelevant <i>bonhomie</i> about this
whole speech which struck exactly the right note.
Mrs. Leroy glanced gratefully at her husband,
and lifted her glass. The others did the same.
But it was Joan who spoke first.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hughie!&quot; she cried, with glowing eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hughie!&quot; cried every one. &quot;Good health!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In the times of our prosperity our friends are
always critical, frequently unjust, generally a
nuisance, and sometimes utterly detestable. But
there is no blinking the fact that they are a very
present help in trouble.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie suddenly felt himself unable to speak.
He bowed his head dumbly, and made a furious
onslaught upon a plover&#39;s egg.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[pg&nbsp;292]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chXVI" id="chXVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="h3">IN WHICH CHARITY SUFFERETH LONG, AND<br />
JOAN MISSES HER CUE</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Hughie</span> spent the next few months chiefly in
wondering.</p>

<p class="indent">He wondered what Mr. Haliburton&#39;s game
might be. What was he doing behind Lance
Gaymer? That the latter might consider himself
justified in poking his nose into his only sister&#39;s
affairs was understandable enough&mdash;but why
drag in Haliburton? Was that picturesque ruffian
a genuine friend of Lance&#39;s, enlisted in a
brotherly endeavour to readjust Jimmy Marrable&#39;s
exceedingly unsymmetrical disposition
of his property, or was he merely a member of
that far-reaching and conspicuously able fraternity
(known in sporting circles as &quot;The
Nuts&quot;), to whom all mankind is fair game, and
whose one article of faith is a trite proverb on the
subject of a fool and his money, pursuing his
ordinary avocation of &quot;making a bit&quot;? In other
words, was Lance Gaymer pulling Haliburton,
or was Haliburton pushing Lance Gaymer?</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie also wondered about a good many other
things, notably&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>a</i>) Joan.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg&nbsp;293]</span>
(<i>b</i>) More Joan; coupled with dim speculations
as to how it was all going to end.</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>c</i>) More Joan still; together with a growing
desire to go off again to the ends of the earth and
lose himself.</p>

<p class="indent">But for the present life followed an uneventful
course. Since Lance&#39;s display of fireworks at
Hughie&#39;s luncheon-party, Hughie&#39;s friends had
studiously avoided the mention of the word money
in their late host&#39;s presence; and Master Lance
himself, evidently realizing that, however excellent
his intentions or pure his motives, he had
made an unmitigated ass of himself, avoided
Hughie&#39;s society entirely.</p>

<p class="indent">Of Joan Hughie saw little until the beginning
of October, when he arrived at Manors to shoot
pheasants.</p>

<p class="indent">He was greeted, almost with tears of affection,
by John Alexander Goble, who had been retained
by Jack Leroy as butler when Hughie relinquished
his services; and found the house
packed with young men and maidens, the billiard-room
strewn with many-hued garments,
and the atmosphere charged with the electricity
of some great enterprise in the making.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Theatricals!&quot; explained Mrs. Leroy resignedly,
as she handed him his tea. &quot;Tableaux,
rather. At least, it is a sort of variety entertainment,&quot;
she concluded desperately, &quot;in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg&nbsp;294]</span>
Parish Hall. In aid of some charity or other, but
that doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Joey&#39;s latest, I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; the child is wild about it. What, sweet
one?&quot; (This to the infant Hildegard, in an attitude
of supplication at her side.) &quot;Cake? certainly
not! You are going out to tea at the Rectory
in half an hour. Do you remember what
happened the last time you had two teas?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Stodger reflected, and remembered; but
pleaded, in extenuation,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I did it <i>all</i> at the Rectory, mummy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She was sick,&quot; explained her sister, turning
politely to Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Twice!&quot; corroborated Stodger, not without
pride.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; in a decent basin provided by the parish,&quot;
continued Duckles hazily. She had recently
begun to attend church, and her reading during
the sermon had opened to her a new and fertile
field for quotation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me more about the tableaux, Jack,&quot; said
Hughie hastily, as Mrs. Leroy accelerated her
ritualistic progeny&#39;s departure upstairs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They&#39;re spendin&#39; lashings of money on them.
Won&#39;t make a farthing profit, I don&#39;t suppose;
but the show should be all right. They&#39;re getting
a &#39;pro.&#39; down to stage-manage &#39;em.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My word, they are going it! Hallo, Joey!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>[pg&nbsp;295]</span>
Miss Gaymer&#39;s entrance brought theatrical
conversation up to fever heat; and for the rest of
the meal, and indeed for the next few days,
Hughie lived and breathed in a world composed
of rickety scenery, refractory pulleys, and hot
size, inhabited by people who were always talking,
usually cross, and most intermittent in their
feeding-times.</p>

<p class="indent">One afternoon Joan took him down to the Hall,
ostensibly as a companion, in reality to shift some
large flats of scenery, too wide for feminine arms
to span.</p>

<p class="indent">Captain Leroy had already offered himself in
that capacity, but his services had been brutally
declined, on the ground that the scenery was not
concave.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The programmes are being printed to-day.
We are going to have the tableaux in the first
half,&quot; Joan rattled on, as they walked through
the plantations. &quot;Well-known pictures, you
know. Some of them are perfectly lovely. I am
in three,&quot; she added, rather naïvely.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie asked for details.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, the first one is to be The Mirror of
Venus&mdash;a lot of girls looking into a pool.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you in that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not much! <i>That</i> is for all the riff-raff who
have crowded in without being invited&mdash;the
Mellishes, and the Crumfords, and the Joblings.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg&nbsp;296]</span>
(You know the lot!) There&#39;s another tableau
for their men: <i>such</i> horrors, my dear! But that
disposes of them for Part One: they don&#39;t have
to appear again until the waxworks. Then there&#39;s
a perfectly sweet one&mdash;The Gambler&#39;s Wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is she to be?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sylvia Tarrant. She sits under a tree in an
old garden, looking sad,&quot; gabbled Joan without
pausing, &quot;while her husband gambles with some
other men on the lawn behind. You&#39;ll cry! I
come after that&mdash;Two Strings to her Bow. A
girl walking arm-in-arm with two men. She looks
quite pleased with herself: the men have both got
camelious hump.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who are they?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s not quite settled yet. I told them they
could fight it out among themselves. I expect it
will be Binks and Cherub, though. But they
must decide soon, because time is getting on, and
Mr. Haliburton says&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Haliburton.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Haliburton?&quot; said Hughie, stopping short.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Didn&#39;t you know? He is stage-managing
us. He came down this morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is he staying in the house?&quot; was Hughie&#39;s
next question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No: we couldn&#39;t get him in. He&#39;s putting
up at The Bull, in the village,&quot; said Joan. &quot;I wish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>[pg&nbsp;297]</span>
we could have found room for him,&quot; she added,
with intention. She knew that most men neither
loved Mr. Haliburton nor approved of their girl
friends becoming intimate with him; and this
alone was quite sufficient to predispose her in
that misjudged hero&#39;s favour.</p>

<p class="indent">In her heart of hearts Miss Gaymer was just a
little <i>éprise</i> with Mr. Haliburton, and, as becomes
one who is above such things, just a little
ashamed of the fact. She had found something
rather compelling in his dark eyes and silky
ways, but, being anything but a susceptible young
person, rather resented her own weakness. Still,
the fact remained. She had seen a good deal of
Mr. Haliburton in London&mdash;how, she could
hardly explain, though possibly Mr. Haliburton
could have done so&mdash;and had listened, not altogether
unmoved, to tales of a patrimony renounced
for Art&#39;s sake, of an ancestral home
barred by a hot-headed but lovable &quot;old pater&quot;;
and to various reflections, half-humorous, half-pathetic,
on the subject of what might have been
if this world were only a juster place.</p>

<p class="indent">Joan, who did not know that Mr. Haliburton&#39;s
ancestral home had been situated over a tobacconist&#39;s
shop somewhere between the back of
Oxford Street and Soho Square, and that his &quot;old
pater&quot; had but lately retired from the post of
head waiter at a theatrical restaurant in Maiden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>[pg&nbsp;298]</span>
Lane, in order to devote his undivided attention
to the more perfect colouring of an already carnelian
proboscis, felt distinctly sorry for her romantic
friend. When a young girl begins to feel
sorry for a man, the position is full of possibilities;
and when heavy-handed and purblind authority
steps in and forbids the banns, so to speak,
the possibilities become probabilities, and, in
extreme cases, certainties.</p>

<p class="indent">Joan glanced obliquely at Hughie. That impassive
young man was advancing with measured
strides, frowning ferociously. She continued, not
altogether displeased:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The next tableau is Flora Macdonald&#39;s Farewell&mdash;very
Scotch. A man in a kilt stands in
the centre&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She babbled on, but Hughie&#39;s attention wandered.</p>

<p class="indent">Haliburton again! He did not like the idea.
Consequently it was not altogether surprising if,
when Joan paused to enquire whether he regarded
Queen Elizabeth or a suffragette as the
most suitable vehicle for one of Mrs. Jarley&#39;s
most cherished &quot;wheezes,&quot; Hughie should have
replied:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Joan, how did that chap come here? Was he
engaged by you, or did he offer himself?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He offered himself&mdash;very kindly!&quot; said
Joan stiffly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[pg&nbsp;299]</span>
&quot;I suppose he is being paid?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, of course&mdash;a guinea or two. It&#39;s his
profession,&quot; said Joan impatiently. &quot;Do you
object?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The occasion called for considerable tact, and
poor heavy-handed Hughie sighed in anticipation.
Joan heard him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What <i>is</i> the trouble?&quot; she asked, more
amused than angry. &quot;Out with it, old Conscientiousness?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Joey,&quot; said Hughie, &quot;I don&#39;t like the idea of
your taking up with that chap.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On the whole, it could not have been put
worse.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It seems to me,&quot; said Miss Gaymer scornfully,
&quot;that it&#39;s not women who are spiteful, but men.
I wonder why every male I know is so down on
poor Mr. Haliburton. Silly children like Binks
and Cherub I can understand, but <i>you</i>, Hughie&mdash;you
ought to be above that sort of thing.
What&#39;s the matter with the man, that you all
abuse him so? Tell me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie&#39;s reply to this tirade was lame and
unconvincing. The modern maiden is so amazingly
worldly-wise on various matters on the subject
of which she can have had no other informant
than her own intuitions, that she is apt to
scout the suggestion that there are certain phases
of life of which happily she as yet knows nothing;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[pg&nbsp;300]</span>
and any attempt to hint the same to her is scornfully
greeted as a piece of masculine superiority.
Consequently Joey thought she knew all about
Mr. Haliburton; wherein she was manifestly
wrong, but not altogether to be blamed; for when
your knowledge of human nature, so far as it
goes, is well-nigh perfect, it is difficult for you to
believe that it does not go all the way.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a most unsatisfactory conversation. All
Hughie did was to reiterate his opinion of Mr.
Haliburton without being able (or willing) to
furnish any fresh facts in support of it; and the
only apparent result was to prejudice Joan rather
more violently in Haliburton&#39;s favour than before,
and to make Hughie feel like a backbiter
and a busybody. It was a relief when Joan
abruptly changed the conversation, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hughie, have you seen anything of Lance
lately?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">No, Hughie had not. &quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m bothered about him,&quot; said Joan, descending
from her high horse and slipping into
what may be called her confidential mood. &quot;He
used to write to me pretty regularly, even after he
married that freak, and we were always fond of
one another, even though we quarrelled sometimes.
But he seems to have dropped out of
things altogether lately. Do you know what he
is doing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg&nbsp;301]</span>
&quot;Can&#39;t say, I&#39;m sure,&quot; said Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Could you find out for me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I will,&quot; said Hughie, quite forgetting
the present awkwardness of his relations
with Lance in the light of the joyous fact that
Lance&#39;s sister had just asked him to do her a service.
&quot;I&#39;ll go and look him up. He may be ill,
or short of cash. But can&#39;t you get news of him
from&mdash;from&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He stopped suddenly. He had been about to
ask a question which had just struck him as
rather ungenerous.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mean from Mr. Haliburton?&quot; said Joan,
with her usual directness. &quot;I did ask him, but
he says he has seen nothing of Lance for quite a
long time; so I&#39;m afraid I must bother you,
Hughie. I don&#39;t like to, because I know you
won&#39;t want to go out of your way on his account,
after&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind that!&quot; said Hughie hastily.
&quot;I&#39;ll go and look him up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Joan turned to him gratefully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re a good sort, Hughie,&quot; she said. &quot;I
don&#39;t know what I should do without you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie glowed foolishly. Her words did not
mean anything, of course; still, they warmed
him for the time being. He never thought of
making capital out of Joan&#39;s impulsive outbursts
of affection. He regarded them as a sort of consolation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[pg&nbsp;302]</span>
prize&mdash;nothing more. He had never
attempted to make love to her since his first rebuff.
The memory of that undignified squabble
still made him tingle, and in any case it would
never have occurred to him to renew the attack.
Man-like, he had taken for granted the rather
large proposition that a woman invariably means
what she says. To pester Joan with further attentions,
especially in his exceptional position,
savoured to him of meanness.</p>

<p class="indent">For all that, the girl and he seemed of late to
have adjusted their relations with one another.
Joan never played with him now, encouraging
him one moment and flouting him the next, as in
the case of most of her faithful band. Her attitude
was that of a good comrade. She was content to
sit silent in his company, which is a sound test of
friendship; she brought to him her little troubles,
and occasionally ministered to his; and in every
way she showed him that she liked and trusted
him. A vainer or cleverer man would have taken
heart of grace at these signs. Hughie did not.
He was Joan&#39;s guardian, and as such entitled to
her confidence; also her very good friend, and as
such entitled to her affection. That was all. It
was rotten luck, of course, that she was not sufficiently
fond of him to marry him, but then rotten
luck is a thing one must be prepared for in this
world. He would get accustomed to the situation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[pg&nbsp;303]</span>
in time: meanwhile there must be no more
castles in the air.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll tell you what,&quot; he continued presently.
&quot;I shall be in town on Wednesday. I&#39;ll go and
look Lance up then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Hughie,&quot; cried Joan in dismay, &quot;Wednesday
is the day of the entertainment. You <i>must</i>
come to that. What is your engagement, if it&#39;s
not indiscreet to inquire?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dentist,&quot; said Hughie lugubriously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dentist?&quot; Joan laughed, or rather crowed,
in her characteristically childlike way. &quot;Hughie
at the dentist&#39;s! It seems so funny,&quot; she
explained apologetically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will be the reverse of funny,&quot; said Hughie
severely, &quot;when he gets hold of me. Do you
know how long it is since I sat in a dentist&#39;s
chair? Eight years, no less!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ll catch it!&quot; said Miss Gaymer confidently.
&quot;But you simply must not go on that day.
I want you at the show. Can&#39;t you change the
date?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The assassin gave me to understand,&quot; said
Hughie, &quot;that it was a most extraordinary piece
of luck for me that he should be able to take me
at all; and he rather suggested that if I broke
the appointment I need not expect another on
this side of the grave. Besides, next Wednesday
is about our one off-day from shooting. I also&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>[pg&nbsp;304]</span>
Miss Gaymer fixed a cold and accusing eye
on him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Confess, miserable shuffler!&quot; she said. &quot;You
arranged that date with the dentist on purpose,
so as to escape the theatricals.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Guilty, my lord!&quot; replied the criminal resignedly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you are let off with a caution,&quot; said
Joan graciously, &quot;but you&#39;ll have to come, all
the same. You <i>will</i>, won&#39;t you, Hughie?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will my presence make so much difference?&quot;
said Hughie, rather boldly for him. He was inviting
a heavy snub, and he knew it.</p>

<p class="indent">Joan raised her eyes to his for a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, rather unexpectedly, &quot;it will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I&#39;ll come,&quot; said Hughie, with vigour.
&quot;I go to the dentist at ten. I&#39;ll get that over,
ask Lance to lunch, and come down by the afternoon
train. What time does the show begin?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Eight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The train gets in at seven-fifty. I&#39;ll come
straight to the Parish Hall&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ll get no dinner,&quot; said Joan in warning
tones.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind!&quot; said Hughie heroically.
&quot;There&#39;s to be a supper afterwards, isn&#39;t there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll last out, then. By the way, does it matter
if I&#39;m not in evening kit?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg&nbsp;305]</span>
&quot;Not a bit, if you don&#39;t mind yourself. Of
course the front rows will be full of people with
their glad rags on,&quot; said Joan. &quot;But if you feel
shy, come round behind the scenes. Then you&#39;ll
be able to keep an eye on me&mdash;and Mr. Haliburton!&quot;
she added, with a provocative little
glance.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Hughie duly departed to town, promising faithfully
to come back for the theatricals, and wondering
vaguely why Joan had insisted so strongly
on his doing so. Joan felt rather inclined to
wonder herself. She was a little perplexed by her
own impulses at present. But her mind was occupied
by some dim instinct of self-preservation,
and she felt somehow distinctly happier when
Hughie promised to come.</p>

<p class="indent">However, there was little time for introspection.
Rehearsals&mdash;&quot;with the accent on the
hearse,&quot; as Mr. Binks remarked during one protracted
specimen&mdash;were dragging their slow
length along to a conclusion; tickets were selling
like hot cakes; and presently the great day came.</p>

<p class="indent">Amateur theatricals are a weariness to the
flesh, but viewed in the right spirit they are by
no means destitute of entertainment. The
drama&#39;s laws, as interpreted by the amateur,
differ materially from those observed by the professional
branch&mdash;the members of which, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>[pg&nbsp;306]</span>
must be remembered, have to please to live&mdash;in
several important particulars; and with these
the intending playgoer should at once make
himself conversant.</p>

<p class="indent">Here is a <i>précis</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">(1) Remember that the performance has been
got up entirely for the benefit of the performers,
and that you and the rest of the audience have
merely been brought in to make the thing worth
while.</p>

<p class="indent">(2) Abandon all hope of punctuality at the
start or reasonability in the length of the intervals.
Amateur scene-shifters and musicians do
not relish having their &quot;turns&quot; curtailed any
more than the more conspicuous members of the
cast.</p>

<p class="indent">(3) Bear in mind the fact that the play is <i>not</i>
the thing, but the players. The most thrilling
Third Act is as dross compared with the excitement
and suspense of watching to see whether
Johnny Blank will <i>really</i> kiss Connie Dash in the
proposal scene, or whether the fact (known to at
least two-thirds of the audience) that they have
not been on speaking terms for the past six
months will result in the usual amateur <i>ne plus
ultra</i>&mdash;a sort of frustrated peck, falling short by
about six inches. Again, the joy of hearing the
hero falter in a stirring apostrophe to the gallery
is enhanced by the knowledge that he is reading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>[pg&nbsp;307]</span>
it from inside the crown of his hat, and has lost
the place: while the realistic and convincing air
of deference with which the butler addresses the
duchess is the more readily recognized and appreciated
by an audience who are well aware that he
happens in private life to be that lady&#39;s husband.</p>

<p class="indent">The entertainment to which we must now
draw the reader&#39;s unwilling attention was to consist
of three parts. First, the Tableaux Vivants&mdash;thirty
seconds of tableaux to about ten minutes
of outer darkness and orchestral selection;
then a comedietta; and finally, Mrs. Jarley&#39;s
Waxworks.</p>

<p class="indent">The largest room behind the scenes had been
reserved for the lady <i>artistes</i>; a draughty passage,
furnished chiefly with flaring candles and soda-water
syphons, being apportioned to the gentlemen.
The <i>loge des dames</i> was a bare and cheerless
apartment, but tables and mirrors had been
placed round the walls; and here some fifteen or
twenty maidens man&oelig;uvred with freezing politeness
or unrestrained elbowings (according to
their shade of social standing) for positions
favourable to self-contemplation.</p>

<p class="indent">Joan and Sylvia Tarrant foregathered in the
middle of the floor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think we&#39;d better dress here, dear,&quot; said
Joan cheerfully, &quot;and leave the nobility and gentry
to fight for the dressing-tables. After all,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>[pg&nbsp;308]</span>
she added complacently, &quot;you and I need the
least doing up of any of them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The tableaux on the whole were a success,
though it was some time before the audience were
permitted to inspect them. The musical director,
a nervous individual with a <i>penchant</i> for applied
science, had spent the greatest part of two days in
fixing up an electric bell of heroic proportions
controlled from the conductor&#39;s desk, and ringing
into the ear of the gentleman in charge of the
lighting arrangements. A carefully type-written
document (another by-product of the musician&#39;s
versatility) apprised this overwrought official that
one ring signified &quot;stage-lights up,&quot; and two
rings &quot;stage-lights down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Just before the curtain rose for the first tableau
the conductor pressed his button once. After an
interval of about two seconds, since the stage-lights
showed no inclination to go up,&mdash;as a
matter of fact the controller of illuminants was
tenderly nursing a hopelessly perforated eardrum,&mdash;the
agitated musician, convinced that
the bell had not rung, rang it again. Consequently,
just as the curtain rose, every single
lamp on the stage, from the footlights to the overhead
battens, was hastily extinguished. Confusion
reigned supreme. The conductor pressed
his button frantically and continuously; the electrician
lost his head completely, and began to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>[pg&nbsp;309]</span>
turn off switches which controlled the lights in
the dressing-rooms and the hall itself; while the
faithful orchestra, suddenly bereft of both light
and leadership, endeavoured with heroic but
misguided enthusiasm to keep the flag flying by
strident improvisations of the most varied and
individual character.</p>

<p class="indent">The audience, who had come prepared for
anything, sat unmoved; but dolorous cries were
heard from the dressing-rooms and vestibule.
Above all rose the voice of the conductor, calling
aloud for the blood of the electrician and refusing
to be comforted. The first <i>tableau vivant</i> partook
of the nature of an &quot;extra turn,&quot; and was not foreshadowed
in the programme. It took place in the
middle of the stage, and depicted two overheated
gentlemen (one carrying a <i>bâton</i> and the other
<i>en déshabille</i>) explaining (<i>fortissimo</i>) the purport
of a type-written document to a third (who
caressed his right ear all the time) by the light of
a single wax vesta.</p>

<p class="indent">After this gratuitous contribution to the gaiety
of the proceedings the official programme came
into force, and various attractive and romantic
visions were unfolded to the audience. Certainly
the tableaux were well mounted. The success of
A Gambler&#39;s Wife and Two Strings to her Bow
was beyond question. Haliburton, too, made a
striking appearance in Orchardson&#39;s Hard Hit&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>[pg&nbsp;310]</span>
famous gambling picture with the countless
packs of cards strewn upon the floor&mdash;wherein
the broken gamester turns with his hand on the
door-handle to take a last look at the three men
who have mastered him.</p>

<p class="indent">There were minor blemishes, of course. The
composure of the beauteous band who were discovered&mdash;when
the conductor had been hounded
back to his stool and the bemused electrician replaced
by a man of more enduring fibre&mdash;contemplating
their own charms in The Mirror of
Venus was utterly wrecked&mdash;yea, transformed
into helpless giggles&mdash;by a totally unexpected
ejaculation of &quot;Good old Gertie!&quot; proceeding
from a young man in the front row&mdash;evidently
a brother&mdash;chiefly remarkable for a made-up
tie and a red silk handkerchief, and directed apparently
(if one may judge by consequences) at a
massively-built young woman kneeling third from
the end on the prompt side. During another tableau,
as Prince Charles stood rigid in the embrace
of Flora Macdonald, the audience sat spellbound
for thirty breathless seconds, what time the unhappy
prince&#39;s tartan stockings slipped inch by
inch from the neighbourhood of his knees, past
the boundary line where artificial brown left off
and natural white began, right down to his ankles&mdash;a
<i>contretemps</i> which, as Mr. D&#39;Arcy remarked
to Mrs. Leroy, added a touch of animation to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>[pg&nbsp;311]</span>
what would otherwise have been a somewhat
lifeless representation.</p>

<p class="indent">The comedietta was not an unqualified success.
It was one of those characteristic products of what
may be called the Back-Drawing-Room School,
in which complications begin shortly after the
rise of the curtain with the delivery and perusal
of a certain letter, and are automatically adjusted
at the end of about thirty-five minutes by
the introduction of another, which explains everything,
settles differences, precipitates engagements,
and brings the curtain down upon all the
characters standing in a row in carefully assorted
couples.</p>

<p class="indent">This somewhat trite and conventional plot was
agreeably varied by the vagaries of the talented
gentleman who played the footman responsible
for the delivery of the letters. He brought on the
second letter first, with the result that the heroine
found herself exclaiming: &quot;How foolish I have
been! Gerald had been true to me through all!
I must go to him at once! We can be married
to-morrow!&quot; after the drama had been in progress
some three minutes,&mdash;a catastrophe only
tided over by some perfectly Napoleonic &quot;gagging&quot;
by the comic man and an entirely unrehearsed
entrance (with obvious assistance from
the rear) of the footman, with the right letter.</p>

<p class="indent">Fortunately these divergences from the drama&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>[pg&nbsp;312]</span>
normal course were lost upon the majority of the
audience; for the actors, whether from nervousness
or frank boredom, were inaudible beyond
the first three rows of seats. Even here the feat
of following the drift of the dialogue was rendered
almost impossible by the persistent and
frantic applause of two obvious &quot;deadheads&quot;
in the front row,&mdash;poor relations of the gentleman
who played the footman,&mdash;who, since they
occupied free seats, evidently considered it their
bounden duty to applaud every entrance and exit
of their munificent relative, even when he came
on with the wrong letter or was elbowed off to
fetch the right one. The only member of the
company who performed his duties with anything
like thoroughness was the prompter, a retired
major with lungs of brass. He had evidently
decided, with the true instinct of a strong man,
that if you want a thing well done you must do
it yourself. Consequently his voice re-echoed
through the hall in an unceasing monologue which,
while it lacked the variety inseparable from the
deliverances of a whole company, did much to keep
the occupants of the back benches <i>au fait</i> with
the intricacies of the plot. The best laugh of the
evening, however, was aroused by the temerity
of one of the actors, who suddenly interrupted
the prompter to remark mildly but distinctly:
&quot;All right, old man, I know this bit!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>[pg&nbsp;313]</span>
Then came Mrs. Jarley&#39;s Waxworks. The
curtain rose upon the usual group of historical
and topical characters, seated round the stage in a
semicircle, most of them twitching with incipient
hysteria, and all resolutely avoiding the eye of the
audience. Presently Mrs. Jarley (Binks), accompanied
by Master Jarley (Cherub, in a sailor suit
and white socks), made her appearance, and
plunged into a slightly laboured monologue,
what time her offspring walked round the stage,
and, by dint of dusting, oiling, and other operations,
stimulated any of the figures which could
possibly have been mistaken for waxworks into
a fitting display of life and activity.</p>

<p class="indent">One &quot;Mrs. Jarley&quot; is very like another, and
the audience, who were beginning to suffer from
a slight attack of theatrical indigestion, were
a little slow in responding to Binks&#39;s hoary
&quot;wheezes&quot; and unfathomable topical allusions.
It was not until a bench at the back of the stage,
occupied by Oliver Cromwell, General Booth,
Dorando, and a Suffragette, suddenly toppled
over backwards, and discharged its tenants, with
four alarming thuds, into the chasm which
yawned between the back of the staging and the
wall, that the entertainment could be said to have
received a proper fillip. After the first sensation
of surprise and resentment at finding themselves
reposing upon the backs of their necks in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>[pg&nbsp;314]</span>
dust, the four gentlemen affected (who, it is to
be feared, had been priming themselves for this,
their first appearance on any stage, in the customary
manner) accepted the situation with heroic
resignation. Remembering that they were waxworks,
and for that if for no other reason incapable
of getting up, they continued in their present
posture, invisible to the naked eye except for
their legs, which stuck straight up into the air.
The flagging audience, imagining that the entire
disaster was part of the performance, applauded
uproariously, and Mrs. Jarley seized the opportunity
to deliver a pithy <i>extempore</i> lecture upon
character as read from the soles of the feet.</p>

<p class="indent">The performance concluded with a song and
chorus, specially composed for the occasion, and
sung by Mrs. Jarley and her exhibits in spasmodic
antistrophe. Mrs. Jarley began,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Some ladies have one figure&mdash;one, home grown!</span><br />
<span class="i2">But I have quite a lot, like Madam Tussaud.</span><br />
<span class="i0">And whatever sort of one you&#39;d like to own,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Just order me to make it, and I&#39;ll do so.</span><br />
<span class="i0">I can make you waxen figures that can walk,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Or wave their arms, or turn and look behind &#39;em&mdash;&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Here, in attempting to suit the action to the word,
the singer tripped heavily over her own train, and
was only saved from complete <i>bouleversement</i> by
the miraculously animated and suddenly outstretched
arm of Henry the Eighth, who was sitting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>[pg&nbsp;315]</span>
close behind. Binks continued, quite undisturbed,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;And some of them (the female ones!) can talk,</span><br />
<span class="i2">And it&#39;s wonderful how useful people find them.</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;So send for Mrs. Jarley on the spot!</span><br />
<span class="i0">And she&#39;ll reproduce each feature that you&#39;ve got.</span><br />
<span class="i4">It will save a deal of trouble</span><br />
<span class="i4">If you have a waxen double,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Which will do your work when you would rather not!&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now then, waxworks! All together! Give
them a lead, Sousa!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Sousa (second from the end, o. p. side)
obediently began to agitate his <i>bâton</i>, partially
scalping Sunny Jim in the process, and the waxworks
sang out, <i>fortissimo</i>, with a distinct but
unevenly distributed <i>accelerando</i> toward the
end,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Then send for Mrs. Jarley on the spot!</span><br />
<span class="i0">And she&#39;ll reproduce each feature that you&#39;ve got.</span><br />
<span class="i4">All your business she will see to,</span><br />
<span class="i4">Black your boots, and make your tea, too,</span><br />
<span class="i0">If you&#39;ll only put a penny in the slot!&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The tune was good, and the chorus went with a
swing. But now a difficulty arose. The second
verse should have been sung by one of the late
occupants of the back bench&mdash;Dorando, to be
precise; and Mrs. Jarley, realizing the circumstance,
was on the point of beginning it herself,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>[pg&nbsp;316]</span>
when a muffled voice, proceeding apparently from
the infernal regions, struck into the opening lines.
Dorando, faint yet pursuing, was evidently determined
to fulfil his contract, even if he had to do
it on his head. For various reasons (chiefly dust
and incipient apoplexy), his articulation was not
all that could be desired, and the verse, which told
of the ingenious device of one Tommy Sparkes,
who, faced by the prospect of corporal punishment,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&quot;Sent for Mrs. Jarley on the spot,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And explained that he was going to get it hot&quot;&mdash;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">whereupon that resourceful lady</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&quot;Made a figure, small and ruddy,</span><br />
<span class="i4">To be Tommy&#39;s understudy;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the figure got&mdash;what Tommy should have got!&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">was lost upon the audience. But every one
took up the chorus with a will, and the third
verse entered upon its career under the happiest
auspices.</p>

<p class="indent">On this occasion the lines were distributed
among the figures themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;Now Mrs. Bumble-Doodle gave a ball&quot;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">began Queen Elizabeth;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;But twenty-seven men all wired to say&quot;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">continued Peter Pan;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>[pg&nbsp;317]</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;That they very much regretted, after all&quot;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">carolled Sunny Jim;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;To find they simply <i>couldn&#39;t</i> get away!&quot;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">bellowed a voice (Oliver Cromwell&#39;s) from under
the platform.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;Said Mrs. Bumble-Doodle, in despair&quot;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">resumed Master Jarley, after a yell of laughter
had subsided;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;The ball will be a failure&mdash;not a doubt of it!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">announced a Pierrette, with finality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;The girls won&#39;t find a single partner there&quot;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">wailed a waxwork in a kilt (possibly Rob Roy or
Harry Lauder)&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a break. The piano paused expectantly,
and all the waxworks turned their heads
(most unprofessionally) to see what had happened
to Cherry Ripe, whose turn it was to sing the next
verse. Apparently that lady had permitted her
attention to wander, for she was scrutinising the
audience, to the neglect of her cue. The sudden
silence&mdash;or possibly the attentions of Master
Jarley, who bustled up and assiduously oiled her
mouth and ears&mdash;seemed to recall her errant
wits.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sorry!&quot; she remarked calmly, and sang in a
clear voice,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, what a mess! How are we to get out of it?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>[pg&nbsp;318]</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;She sent for Mrs. Jarley on the spot!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">declaimed that lady triumphantly,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&quot;And the girls were quite content with what they got.</span><br />
<span class="i4">True, a dummy cannot flirt;</span><br />
<span class="i4">But he does not tear your skirt,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Or say that he can dance when he can not!&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, then, <i>all</i> together!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Jarley, waxworks, and audience swung
into the final chorus. Even the four inverted
Casabiancas at the back assisted by swinging
their legs.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;She sent for Mrs. Jarley on the spot!</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the girls were quite content with what they got.</span><br />
<span class="i2">They were spared that youth entrancing,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Who says: &#39;I don&#39;t much care for dancing,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But I don&#39;t mind sitting out with you&mdash;eh, what?&#39;&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">But Cherry Ripe was not singing. She was saying
to herself,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not in the hall, and not behind the scenes! I
wonder where he can have got to! He <i>may</i> have
missed his train, of course; but then he could
have wired, hours ago. Well, Hughie, <i>mon ami</i>,
if that&#39;s the way you treat invitations&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the curtain had fallen, and all the waxworks
were scuffling off their high chairs and
trooping to the dressing-rooms. Cherry Ripe,
following their example, put an arm round Pierrette,
and said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>[pg&nbsp;319]</span>
&quot;Come along, Sylvia! Home, supper, and a
dance! That&#39;s the programme now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On reaching Manors, Joan enquired of Mr.
Goble,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is Mr. Hughie back, John?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Deed, no, mem.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Any telegram, or anything?&quot; asked Joan
carelessly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Naething whatever! He&#39;ll no be back till the
morn, I doot,&quot; said Mr. Goble.</p>

<p class="indent">Two hours later, when supper was over and
the dancing at its height, Mr. Haliburton approached
Joan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Our dance, I think, Cherry Ripe?&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">Cherry Ripe concurred.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you come and sit in the conservatory?&quot;
continued Haliburton. &quot;I want to say something
particular to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Joan regarded him covertly for a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right!&quot; she said.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>[pg&nbsp;320]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chXVII" id="chXVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="h3">IN WHICH CHARITY BEGINS AT HOME, AND<br />
HUGHIE MISSES HIS TRAIN</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> dentist laid aside his excavating pick with
a regretful sigh, and began to fit what looked like
a miniature circular saw into the end of the electric
drill.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie, recumbent in the chair, telling himself
resolutely that, appearances to the contrary, the
man was doing this because it was really necessary,
and not from mere voluptuousness, cautiously
inserted his tongue into the hole, and calculated
that the final clearance would be a three
minutes&#39; job at the shortest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It seems hard to believe,&quot; said the dentist
morosely, setting the machinery of the drill in motion
with his foot, &quot;that your teeth have not been
attended to for eight years. A little wider, please!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie realised that he was being called a liar
as unmistakably as a man can be; but at this moment
the drill came into full operation, and he
merely gripped the arms of the chair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A man,&quot; continued the dentist, removing the
drill and suddenly syringing the cavity with ice-cold
water,&mdash;&quot;empty, please!&mdash;should make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>[pg&nbsp;321]</span>
a point of having his teeth inspected once every
six months; a woman, once every three.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A man,&quot; replied Hughie (who believed that
the operations with the drill were completed),
&quot;must have his teeth inspected when he can. That
is,&quot; he added rapidly,&mdash;the dentist was deliberately
fitting a fresh tool into the drill,&mdash;&quot;I have
been abroad for the last eight or nine years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Away from civilisation, perhaps,&quot; said the
dentist compassionately, getting good leverage
for his operating hand by using Hughie&#39;s lower
jaw as a fulcrum.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite!&quot; gurgled Hughie, whose head at the
moment was clasped tight to his inquisitor&#39;s waistcoat
buttons.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In that case,&quot; said the dentist in distinctly
mollified tones, &quot;we must not be too hard on you.
Tongue down, please!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He completed his excavating and inundating
operations, and, regretfully pushing away the
arm of the drilling-machine, began to line his victim&#39;s
mouth with some material which tasted
like decomposing sponge-bags.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your teeth have preserved their soundness in
quite an unaccountable way,&quot; he continued,
with the air of a just man conscientiously endeavouring
to minimise a grievance. &quot;There is one
other small hole here,&quot;&mdash;he ran a pointed instrument
well into it to prove his statement,&mdash;&quot;but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>[pg&nbsp;322]</span>
beyond that there is nothing further to find fault
with.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He began to pound up a mysterious mixture in
a small mortar, and ran on:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must have been very careful in your
diet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No sweets,&quot; said Hughie laconically. &quot;And
I used very often to eat my meat right off the bone.
That keeps teeth white, doesn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The dentist put down the mortar with some
deliberation, and glared. Anything in the shape
of levity emanating from occupants of the rack
jars upon a Chief Tormentor&#39;s sense of what is
professionally proper. But Hughie was lying back
in the chair with his mouth open and eyes shut,
exhibiting no sign of humorous intention. Still,
this must not occur again. The dentist looked
round for a gag. He produced from somewhere
a long snaky india-rubber arrangement, terminating
in a hooked nozzle. This he hung over
Hughie&#39;s lower &#949;&#961;&#954;&#959;&#962;
  &#959;&#948;&#959;&#957;&#932;&#969;&#957;, effectually stifling
his utterance and reducing his share in the conversation
to a sort of Morse Code of single
gurgles and long-drawn sizzles suggestive of the
emptying of a bath.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, taking up his mortar, he proceeded, with
the air of one who is using a giant&#39;s strength magnanimously,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have visited the Antipodes, perhaps?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>[pg&nbsp;323]</span>
&quot;Gug-gug-guggle!&quot; proceeded from the india-rubber-lined
orifice before him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! that must have been very interesting,&quot;
continued the dentist. &quot;Had you many opportunities
of discussing the question of Colonial Preference
with the leading men out there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Glug!&quot; came the reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That was unfortunate. But perhaps you were
able to form some idea of the general Australian
attitude towards the question?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;G-r-r-r-r-r! Guggle, guggle! Ch&#39;k, ch&#39;k!&quot;
observed Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Personally,&quot; continued the dentist, rolling the
pulverised substance in the mortar between his
finger and thumb, and lighting a spirit-lamp, &quot;I
am an ardent upholder of the principles of that
truly great man, the immortal Richard Cobden.
Are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie, thoughtlessly lifting the gag for a moment,
replied&mdash;with fatal distinctness.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a mad act. The dentist simply took up
a humorous-looking bulb-shaped appliance, and
having filled it with red-hot air at the spirit-lamp,
discharged its contents, in one torrid blast, into
the excavated tooth.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Twenty minutes later Hughie was ushered into
the street, and stood poising himself doubtfully
on the doorstep. He did not know what to do.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>[pg&nbsp;324]</span>
Strictly speaking, his next engagement should
have been to entertain Mr. Lance Gaymer at
luncheon. But that exposer of fraudulent trustees
had not replied to Hughie&#39;s written invitation.
Hence Hughie&#39;s stork-like attitude outside the
dentist&#39;s premises. Personally he had not the
slightest desire to entertain Lance Gaymer at
luncheon or any other meal. On the other hand,
he had promised Joan to seek out her brother and
ascertain if all was well with him. Ergo, since
the Mountain declined to come to Mohammed, or
even answer his letters, Mohammed must put his
pride in his pocket and go to the Mountain.</p>

<p class="indent">The prophet accordingly hailed a hansom, and
was directing the cabman to drive to the Mountain&#39;s
residence in Maida Vale,&mdash;a paradoxical
address for a Mountain, by the way,&mdash;when a
strange thing happened. Nay, it was a providential
thing; for if Hughie had not resolutely
summoned up his courage and told the dentist to
go in and finish off the small hole in the last
tooth,&mdash;a treat which that sated epicure was inclined
to postpone until another occasion,&mdash;he
would have hailed this hansom twenty minutes
sooner and so missed his just reward.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Lance Gaymer suddenly came round a
corner of the quiet square, and crossed the road
directly in front of Hughie&#39;s hansom. Hughie
dismounted, and greeted her.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>[pg&nbsp;325]</span>
&quot;Why,&quot; cried Mrs. Lance, &quot;I do declare, it&#39;s
Mr. Marrable!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She smiled upon Hughie in a manner so intoxicating
that the cabman coughed discreetly
to the horse. That intelligent animal made no
comment, but turned round and looked at the
cabman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fancy meeting you!&quot; she continued archly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did your husband get a letter from me yesterday,
Mrs. Gaymer, do you know?&quot; asked
Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">No, Mrs. Gaymer was sure he had not. The
poor boy had took to his bed a week ago, with
the &quot;flu&quot;; so Mrs. Lance had been conducting
his correspondence for him, and could therefore
vouch for the non-arrival of Hughie&#39;s letter.
She hazarded the suggestion that possibly Hughie
had written to Maida Vale.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes. Hughie had.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s it, then!&quot; said Mrs. Lance. &quot;We
moved from there six weeks ago. We live in Balham
now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie was not sufficiently conversant with
suburban caste distinctions to feel sure whether
this was a step up or down in the social scale,
so he merely expressed a hope that Lance was
getting well again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to come and see him, if I may,&quot; he
said. &quot;I asked him to come and lunch with me,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>[pg&nbsp;326]</span>
but I suppose that is out of the question at present.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re right there,&quot; said Mrs. Lance in distinctly
guarded tones. &quot;He ain&#39;t what you&#39;d
call spry. He&#39;s not seeing anybody.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shouldn&#39;t stay long,&quot; urged Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it business?&quot; enquired Mrs. Gaymer with
a touch of hostility.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Gaymer surveyed him curiously. To
most people she would have said flatly and untruthfully
that her husband was unfit to see any
one, for she had her own reasons for discouraging
visitors to Balham just now. But she had always
cherished a weakness for Hugh Marrable.
He treated her exactly as he treated all women&mdash;with
a scrupulous courtesy which, while it
slightly bored frivolous damsels of his acquaintance,
was appreciated at its true value by a lady
whose social status was more than a little equivocal.
It is only when one has secret doubts about
being a real lady that one appreciates being
treated as such.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Could you come to-morrow?&quot; she said at
last.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have to get back to Manors to-night,&quot; said
Hughie. &quot;Might I come out to Balham this
afternoon? Or, better still, will you come and
lunch with me somewhere now, and we can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>[pg&nbsp;327]</span>
drive out there afterwards? Or must you get
back to the invalid?&quot; he added, with just a
suspicion of hopefulness.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Lance, however, expressed her willingness
to come and lunch, but insisted on being allowed
to precede Hughie to Balham by at least one hour.
The house was <i>that</i> untidy! she explained.</p>

<p class="indent">Accordingly Hughie, having decided in his
mind upon an establishment where he would not
be likely to encounter any of his own friends, and
which would yet conform with Mrs. Gaymer&#39;s
notions of what was sufficiently &quot;classy,&quot; conveyed
his fair charge thither in a hansom; and
presently found himself engaged in that traditional
<i>ne plus ultra</i> of dissipation&mdash;the entertainment
of another man&#39;s wife to a meal in a
public restaurant.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Lance, after she desisted from her efforts
to impress upon her host the fact that she was
quite accustomed to this sort of thing, was amusing
enough. She addressed the waiter&mdash;an inarticulate
Teuton&mdash;as &quot;Johnny,&quot; and made a
point of saying a few words to the manager when
he passed their table. She smoked a cigarette
after lunch, and was good enough to commend
Hughie&#39;s taste in champagne&mdash;a brand which
he had hazily recognised in the wine-list as being
the sweetest and stickiest beverage ever distilled
from gooseberries. (It was the sort of champagne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>[pg&nbsp;328]</span>
which goes well with chocolate creams: &quot;Chorus
Girls&#39; Entire,&quot; he remembered they used to call
it.) At any rate it met with Mrs. Lance&#39;s undivided
approval, and Hughie realised for the first
time that a University education can after all be
useful to one in after-life.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly Mrs. Lance enquired:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know any theatrical managers, my
dear boy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, Hughie had come across one or two.
&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; said Mrs. Lance expansively, &quot;you&#39;ve
always treated me like flesh and blood, which is
more than what some of your relations have
done; so I&#39;ll tell you. After all, I&#39;ve got me
feelings, same as&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What about the theatrical managers?&quot; inquired
Hughie tactfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes. Do you think you could ask one
of &#39;em to give me a shop? The chorus would
do. I was in it before,&quot; said Mrs. Gaymer candidly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why do you want to go back there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I&#39;ve got a fancy for it&mdash;that&#39;s all,&quot; replied
Mrs. Gaymer in a thoroughly unconvincing
tone.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie wondered if Lance and his wife were
beginning to tire of one another.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do know one or two men,&quot; he said, &quot;who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>[pg&nbsp;329]</span>
are interested in some of the musical-comedy
syndicates. Shall I try them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you reelly? You&#39;ll be a duck if you do,&quot;
said Mrs. Gaymer.</p>

<p class="indent">After the deliverance of this unsolicited testimonial
Hughie&#39;s guest observed that she must
be getting home, and Hughie, having put her
into a cab and paid the driver, retired to his
club, clogged with viscous champagne and feeling
excessively unwell, to wait until it should be time
for him to follow her.</p>

<p class="indent">To look at the double row of eligible residences
which composed Talbot Street, Balham, you
would hardly have suspected that any of them
would support what the Inland Revenue Schedule
calls a &quot;male servant.&quot; And yet, when Hughie
rang the bell of Number Nineteen, the door was
opened by such an appanage of prosperity. He
was an elderly gentleman with a rheumy but
humorous eye, and a nose which suggested the
earlier stages of elephantiasis. He wore a dress-coat
of distinctly fashionable cut (which, needless
to say, did not fit him) and the regulation
white shirt and collar, the latter quite two sizes
too small; but his boots and trousers apparently
belonged to a totally different class of society.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Name of Marrable?&quot; he enquired, smiling
benevolently upon Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>[pg&nbsp;330]</span>
&quot;Step in. We&#39;ve been expectin&#39; of you for
&#39;alf-an-hour. Don&#39;t wipe your boots on that
mat. It&#39;s worth one-and-eight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After this somewhat remarkable confidence,
the Gaymers&#39; major-domo conducted the visitor
upstairs. Here he threw open a door with truly
theatrical grandeur, and announced,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Ere&#39;s the young toff for you, my de&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, James: that will do,&quot; interposed
Mrs. Lance Gaymer, with a very fair imitation
of the manner of a musical-comedy duchess.
&quot;How do you do, Mr. Marrable?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was attired in the faded glories of a tea-gown,
of a material more pretentious than durable;
and in the half-light of the drawing-room&mdash;the
blinds were partially lowered&mdash;looked
extremely handsome in a tawdry way.</p>

<p class="indent">She apologised for her retainer&#39;s familiarity.
Mr. Marrable would doubtless know what old
servants was. Still, James must certainly be
spoke to about it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ll drink a cup of tea with me,&quot; she continued,
&quot;and then we&#39;ll pop up and see Lance,
pore boy! Ring the bell, please.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie did so, and a rather laborious quarter-of-an-hour
followed. He ploughed his way
through a morass of unlikely topics, while Mrs.
Lance, who was obviously perturbed at the non-appearance
of tea, replied in <i>distrait</i> monosyllables.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>[pg&nbsp;331]</span>
Hughie was conscious about half-way
through the conversation of a faint crash in the
lower regions, and wondered dimly whether calamity
had overtaken the afternoon meal. If so,
he had no doubt as to which of the domestic staff
of Number Nineteen was responsible.</p>

<p class="indent">At last the door opened, and the inestimable
James appeared.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You done it this time!&quot; he remarked severely.
&quot;The &#39;andle of that tea-pot &#39;as came right away
in me &#39;and. It must have been that way this long
while. You won&#39;t get no tea now. Wot&#39;s more,
that tea-pot will &#39;ave to come off the invent&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">By this time Mrs. Lance Gaymer, with dumb
but frenzied signallings, was herding her censorious
hireling through the door, and his concluding
remarks were lost in the passage outside.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently she returned, smiling bravely.
Hughie experienced a sudden pang of pity and
admiration. Lance&#39;s wife was the right sort of
girl after all.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I <i>reelly</i> must apologise&mdash;&quot; she began.</p>

<p class="indent">But Hughie interrupted her. He rose, and
looked her frankly in the face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Gaymer,&quot; he said, &quot;please don&#39;t bother
about keeping up appearances with me. I never
cared a hang about them, and never shall. Tell
me, what are you doing with a bailiff in the
house?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>[pg&nbsp;332]</span>
Mrs. Lance broke down and cried,&mdash;more
from relief than anything else,&mdash;and presently
Hughie, much to his surprise, found himself sitting
beside her, patting her large but shapely
hand, and uttering words of comfort and encouragement
into her ear.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Half an hour later he concluded an interview
with Mr. Albert Mould, broker&#39;s man,&mdash;late
James, the butler,&mdash;in the dingy dining-room
downstairs. The latter gentleman, the more gorgeous
items of his apparel now replaced by garments
of equal social standing with his boots and
trousers, was laboriously writing a receipt with
Hughie&#39;s fountain-pen, following the movements
of the nib with the end of a protruding tongue.
Presently he finished.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There you are, sir,&quot; he said, breathing heavily
upon the paper to dry the ink. &quot;Twenty-seven,
fifteen, eight&mdash;and thank you! What beats me,&quot;
he added reflectively, &quot;is &#39;ow you spotted me.
What was it give me away? Seems to me I
<i>looked</i> all right. I was wearin&#39; the young feller&#39;s
evenin&#39; coat and one of &#39;is shirts, and I thought
I was lookin&#39; a treat all the time. Was it me
trousis?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To avoid wounding his guest&#39;s feelings, Hughie
agreed that it <i>was</i> his trousis.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a queer trade, this of yours,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>[pg&nbsp;333]</span>
&quot;You got to earn a livin&#39; some&#39;ow,&quot; said Mr.
Mould apologetically, &quot;same as any other yewman
bean. It&#39;s not a bad job, as jobs go. They
carry on a lot, o&#39; course, when you&#39;re first put in,
and usually the wife cries; but they soon finds out
as you won&#39;t do &#39;em no &#39;arm. You makes your
inventory and settles down in the kitching, with
a pint o&#39; somethink in your &#39;and an&#39; a pipe in
your face, and in less than &#39;alf a tick you&#39;re one
o&#39; the family, a&#39;most. Why, I&#39;ve &#39;elped wash the
baby afore now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you ever get thrown out?&quot; asked
Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I <i>&#39;ave</i> bin,&quot; replied Mr. Mould, in a tone
which gently reproved the tactlessness of the
question, &quot;but not often. After all, I only come
<i>in</i> agin; and it&#39;s a matter of seven days for assault,
p&#39;raps, on top o&#39; the distraint. Most of &#39;em
&#39;as the sense to remember that, so they humours
me, as it were. They speak me fair, and give me
jobs to do about the house. Still, it were a bit of a
surprise when &#39;er ladyship comes &#39;ome to-day
about two o&#39;clock and asks me would &#39;arf-a-crown
be any good to me, and, if so, would I mind
playin&#39; at bein&#39; a butler for a hour or two. I felt
a fool, like, dressed up that way, but I always
was one to oblige a bit o&#39; skirt. Been weak with
women,&quot; he added autobiographically, &quot;from a
boy. This fer me?&quot; as Hughie opened the street-door
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>[pg&nbsp;334]</span>
and sped the parting guest in a particularly
acceptable manner. &quot;Thank you, Captain!
<i>Good</i> day!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He shuffled down the steps and along the street,
obviously on his way to liquidate Hughie&#39;s half-crown,
and the donor of that gratuity returned
to the dining-room, where he took Mr. Mould&#39;s
laboriously indited receipt from the table. Then
he went upstairs, feeling desperately sorry for
Mr. and Mrs. Lance. He had done what he could
for them, in his eminently practical fashion, and
set them on their feet again; but&mdash;for how long?
Debts! Millstones! Poor things!</p>

<p class="indent">On the landing above he encountered Mrs.
Gaymer, wide-eyed and incredulous.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lance would like to see you now,&quot; she said.
&quot;In here!&quot; She opened a door. &quot;And&mdash;and&mdash;I
say,&quot; she added, half in a whisper, &quot;surely you
don&#39;t mean to say he&#39;s been and <i>gawn</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For answer Hughie awkwardly handed her the
stamped receipt, and passed into the bedroom.</p>

<p class="indent">His interview with Lance lasted an hour and
a half. Much passed between them during that
period, and by the time Hughie rose and said he
must be going, each man had entirely revised his
opinion of the other. Most of us have the right
stuff concealed in us somewhere, however heavily
it may be overlaid by folly or vanity or desire
to make a show. There are few men who do not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>[pg&nbsp;335]</span>
improve on acquaintance, once you get right
through the veneer.</p>

<p class="indent">Poor Lance, struggling in deep waters, suddenly
discovered in the dour and undemonstrative
Hughie a cheerful helper and&mdash;most precious of
all to a proud nature&mdash;an entirely uncritical confidant.
Hughie on his part discovered what he
had rather doubted before, namely, that Lance
was a man. Moreover, he presently laid bare a
truly human and rather sad tale of genuine ability
and secret ambition, heavily handicapped by
youthful cocksureness and want of ballast.</p>

<p class="indent">They discussed many things in that dingy bedroom:
Lance&#39;s past; Uncle Jimmy&#39;s little allowance,
mortgaged many years in advance; the
creditors to whom, together with the law of the
land, he was indebted for the presence beneath
his roof of the versatile Mr. Mould; his future;
the journalistic work which was promised him
as soon as he should be fit again; Mrs. Lance;
and also Mr. Haliburton.</p>

<p class="indent">Joan&#39;s name was barely mentioned. Lance
exhibited a newborn delicacy in the matter. His
officious solicitude on his sister&#39;s behalf was
dead; he knew now that no woman need ever
regret having trusted Hugh Marrable; and he
was content to leave it at that.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I must be moving,&quot; said Hughie at last.
&quot;Buck up, and get fit! It&#39;s good to hear that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>[pg&nbsp;336]</span>
there&#39;s work waiting for you when you get about
again. Grand tonic, that! So long!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He shook Lance&#39;s hand, and the two parted
undemonstratively. Lance made no set speech:
he appreciated Hughie&#39;s desire that there should
be no returning of thanks or contrite expressions
of gratitude. All he said was:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hughie, you are a sportsman!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he settled down on his pillow with a
happy sigh. He had paid Hughie the highest
compliment it was in his power to bestow&mdash;and
that costs an Englishman an effort.</p>

<p class="indent">So they parted. But Mrs. Lance did not let
Hughie off so easily. As she accompanied him
downstairs to open the door for him, she suddenly
seized his hand and kissed it. Tears were
running down her cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie grew red.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say, Mrs. Lance,&quot; he said in clumsy expostulation,
&quot;it&#39;s all right, you know! He&#39;ll soon
be quite well again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me cry,&quot; said Mrs. Lance comfortably.
&quot;It does me good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They stood together in the obscurity of the
shabby little hall, and Hughie, surveying the
flamboyant but homely figure before him, wondered
what the future might hold in store for
this little household. It all depended, of course,
on&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>[pg&nbsp;337]</span>
&quot;Mrs. Lance,&quot; he said suddenly, &quot;tell me&mdash;do
you&mdash;love him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do!&quot; replied Mrs. Lance, in a voice which
for the moment relegated her patchouli and
dyed eyebrows to nothingness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And does he&mdash;love you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He <i>does</i>&mdash;thank God!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are both all right, then,&quot; said Hughie,
nodding a wise head. &quot;Nothing matters much&mdash;except
that!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s true,&quot; said Mrs. Gaymer. &quot;But&mdash;I
wonder how <i>you</i> knew!&quot; she added curiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-bye!&quot; said Hughie.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">As Hughie stood in the darkening street a
church clock began to chime. He looked at his
watch.</p>

<p class="indent">It was six o&#39;clock, and he had promised faithfully
to be at Joey&#39;s entertainment at eight! He
had good reason for his absence, it is true, but a
reason is not always accepted as an excuse.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve fairly torn it, this time!&quot; he reflected
morosely.</p>

<p class="indent">He was right.</p>

<p class="indent">Early next morning he arrived at the village
station by the newspaper train, and made his
way on foot to Manors. A sleepy housemaid was
sweeping out the hall, which was strewn with
<i>confetti</i>,&mdash;some cotillion figures had been included
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>[pg&nbsp;338]</span>
in last night&#39;s festivities,&mdash;and as Hughie
made his way to his dressing-room, intent upon
a bath and shave before breakfast, he reflected
not without satisfaction that, despite Joey&#39;s prospective
fulminations, he had escaped something
by missing his train.</p>

<p class="indent">On his dressing-table he found a note, addressed
to him in Joan&#39;s handwriting. It said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Dear Hughie</span>,&mdash;To-night at the dance Mr.
Haliburton asked me to marry him. Being a
dutiful ward above all things, I have referred
him to you. He is coming to see you to-morrow
afternoon&mdash;that is, if you are back. I hope you
had a good time in town. <span class="ralign">J.</span></p>

<h2><a name="chXVIII" id="chXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="h3"><i>EX MACHINA</i></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Miss Joan Gaymer</span>, pleasantly fatigued after
last night&#39;s dissipation, reclined in a canvas chair
on the lawn at Manors. She had just finished
reading a letter which had arrived by the afternoon
post. It was from her brother Lance, and
conveyed, probably a good deal more fully than
Hughie himself would have done, the reasons
for Hughie&#39;s absence on the previous evening.
Joan&#39;s brow was puckered thoughtfully, and she
surveyed the tips of her small shoes, which were
cocked at an unladylike altitude upon a stool in
front of her, with a profundity of maiden meditation
which was perhaps explained by the fact
that she had received a proposal of marriage the
evening before, and was expecting the proposer
to come and second his own motion at any
moment.</p>

<p class="indent">To her entered suddenly Jno. Alex. Goble.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yon felly!&quot; he intimated austerely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Haliburton, do you mean, John?&quot; inquired
Miss Gaymer, hastily letting down her
feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aye. Wull I loose him in here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>[pg&nbsp;340]</span>
&quot;Yes, please. No&mdash;I mean&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Cupid&#39;s messenger was gone. Presently
he returned, and, with the air of one introducing
the Coroner to the foreman of the jury, announced
Mr. Haliburton.</p>

<p class="indent">That ardent suitor advanced gallantly across
the lawn, and taking Joan&#39;s hand with an air
of respectful rapture, endeavoured to draw its
owner into the shade of the copper beech. Joan
forestalled his intentions by saying at once,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come along into the library, Mr. Haliburton,
and we&#39;ll see what my guardian has to say to
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Haliburton hinted that there was no hurry,
and made a pointed reference to Amaryllis and
the shade; but his unsentimental nymph marched
him briskly across the lawn, round the corner of
the house, and in at the front door.</p>

<p class="indent">They crossed the cool, dark hall, and Joan
tapped at the oaken door of the library.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come in,&quot; said a voice.</p>

<p class="indent">The lovers entered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have brought Mr. Haliburton to see you,
Hughie,&quot; remarked Miss Gaymer, much as one
might announce the arrival of a person to inspect
the gas meter.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Haliburton, who was not the man to show
embarrassment, whether he felt it or not, advanced
easily into the room. Joan surveyed his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id="page341"></a>[pg&nbsp;341]</span>
straight back and square shoulders as he passed
her, and the corners of her mouth twitched, ever
so little.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she looked at Hughie. It was her first
meeting with him since his return home that
morning. He had answered her note by another,
saying that he would be in the library at five
o&#39;clock. There was no twitching about his mouth.
It was closed like a steel trap; and he stood with
his back to the wood-fire which glowed in the
grate&mdash;it was getting on in September, and cold
out of the sun&mdash;with absolute stolidity. Joan
saw at a glance that, whatever the difficulties
of the position, her guardian&#39;s line of action was
now staked out and his mind made up&mdash;one way
or the other.</p>

<p class="indent">She dropped into an arm-chair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, you two,&quot; she remarked encouragingly,
&quot;get to work! I want to hear what each of you
has got to say about my future. It will be quite
exciting&mdash;like going to a palmist!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The two men turned and regarded her in unfeigned
surprise. They had not expected this.
Haliburton began swiftly to calculate whether
Joan&#39;s presence would be a help to him or not.
But Hughie said at once:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must leave us alone, Joan, please! I
can&#39;t possibly allow you to remain.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Joan lay back in her chair and smiled up at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>[pg&nbsp;342]</span>
him, frankly mutinous. She had never yet failed,
when she so desired, to &quot;manage&quot; a man. Hughie
was regarding her stonily; but two minutes, she
calculated, would make him sufficiently pliable.</p>

<p class="indent">She was wrong. At the end of this period
Hughie was still rigidly waiting for her to leave
the room. Joan, a little surprised at his obstinacy,
remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you are going to object to&mdash;to Mr. Haliburton&#39;s
suggestions, Hughie, I think I ought to
hear what the objections are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Before you go,&quot; said Hughie in even tones, &quot;I
will tell you one thing&mdash;and that should be sufficient.
It is this. There is not the slightest prospect
of this&mdash;this engagement coming off. My
reasons for saying so I am prepared to give to Mr.
Haliburton, and if he thinks proper he can communicate
them to you afterwards. But I don&#39;t
think he will. Now will you leave us, please?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Joan was genuinely astonished. But she controlled
herself. She was determined to see the
matter out now. All the woman in her&mdash;and she
was all woman&mdash;answered to the challenge contained
in Hughie&#39;s dictatorial attitude. Besides,
she was horribly curious.</p>

<p class="indent">She heaved a sad little sigh, and made certain
shameless play with her eyes which she knew
stirred poor Hughie to the point of desperation,
and surveyed the result through drooping lashes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>[pg&nbsp;343]</span>
with some satisfaction. Hughie&#39;s mouth was fast
shut, and he was breathing through his nose; and
Joan could see a little pulse beating in his right
temple. (Both of them, for the moment, had
forgotten the ardent suitor by the window.) She
would win through in a moment now.</p>

<p class="indent">But alas! she had forgotten a masculine weapon
against which all the Votes for Women in
the world will avail nothing, when it comes to a
pinch.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie suddenly relaxed his attitude, and
strode across to the door, which he held open for
her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At <i>once</i>, please!&quot; he said in a voice which
Joan had never heard before, though many men
had.</p>

<p class="indent">Without quite knowing why, Miss Gaymer
rose meekly from her chair and walked out of the
room. The door closed behind her.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">When Joan found herself on the lawn again she
gasped a little.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ooh!&quot; she said breathlessly. &quot;I&mdash;I feel just
as if I&#39;d been hit in the face by a big wave! This
game is not turning out quite as you expected,
Joey, my child: the man Hughie is one up! Still,
I&#39;ll take it out of him another time. But&mdash;heavens!&quot;&mdash;She
was staring, like Red Riding-Hood
on a historic occasion, at a recumbent figure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>[pg&nbsp;344]</span>
in her canvas chair beneath the copper beech&mdash;&quot;Who
on <i>earth</i> is that in my chair? It&#39;s&mdash;it&#39;s&mdash;oh!
Joey Gaymer, you&#39;ve got hysterics! It&#39;s&mdash;it&#39;s&mdash;Uncle
Jimmy! <i>Uncle Jimmy!... My
Uncle&mdash;Jimmy!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Next moment she was reposing comfortably, a
distracted bundle of tears and laughter, in the
arms of Jimmy Marrable.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A bit sudden&mdash;eh, young lady?&quot; enquired
that gentleman at last. &quot;I ought to have written,
I suppose. But I quite forgot you would all think
I was dead. Never mind&mdash;I&#39;m not!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He blew his nose resonantly to substantiate his
statement.</p>

<p class="indent">Joan, satisfied at last that he was real, and
greatly relieved to find that she was not suffering
from hysterical delusions arising from Hughie&#39;s
brutal treatment of her, enquired severely of the
truant where he had been for the last five years.</p>

<p class="indent">Jimmy Marrable told her. It was a long story,
and the shadow of the copper beech had perceptibly
lengthened by the time the narrator had embarked
at Zanzibar for the port of Leith. They
had the garden to themselves, for the Leroys were
out.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t want to hear any more adventures,
because I&#39;m simply bursting with questions,&quot;
said Miss Gaymer frankly. &quot;First of all, why did
you go away? You rushed off in such a hurry that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>[pg&nbsp;345]</span>
you had no time to explain. I was barely eighteen
then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was the old failing&mdash;the Marrable wandering
tendency,&quot; replied her uncle. &quot;I had kept
it at bay quite easily for close on fifteen years, but
it came back very hard and suddenly about that
time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Partly, I think, because the only thing that
had kept me at home all those years seemed to be
slipping away from me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I <i>wasn&#39;t</i>!&quot; declared Miss Gaymer stoutly.
Then she reflected. &quot;Do you mean&mdash;all those
silly boys? Was it them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was,&quot; said Jimmy Marrable. &quot;They not
only put my nose out of joint but they bored me
to tears.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You were always worth the whole lot of them
put together, dear,&quot; said Miss Gaymer affectionately.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I knew that,&quot; replied Jimmy Marrable modestly,
&quot;but I wasn&#39;t quite sure if you did. I saw
that for the next two or three years you would be
healthily and innocently employed in making
fools of young men, and so could well afford to do
without your old wreck of an uncle. The serious
part would not come until you grew up to be of a
marriageable age. So I decided in the meanwhile
to treat myself to just one last potter round the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>[pg&nbsp;346]</span>
globe, and then, in a couple of years or so, come
home and assume the onerous duties of chucker-out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then why did you stay away so long?&quot; demanded
Miss Gaymer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I heard Hughie had come home,&quot;
said Jimmy Marrable simply.</p>

<p class="indent">Joan started guiltily, and her hand, which was
resting in one of the old gentleman&#39;s, relaxed its
hold for a moment. Jimmy Marrable noticed
nothing, and proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I got news of him from a man in Cape Town.
His name was Allerton. He seemed a bit of a
rolling stone, but had lately married the proprietress
of a little public-house, Wynberg way, and
was living in great contentment and affluence.
His wife regarded his capture as the crowning
achievement of her life, and altogether they were
a most devoted couple. On hearing that my name
was Marrable, he said he was sure I must be
Hughie&#39;s uncle, as Hughie had told him I was the
only relation he had. He was a gentleman, of
sorts, and seemed to regard friend Hughie as a
kind of cross between Providence and the Rock
of Gibraltar. They had been through some rather
tough times together&mdash;on board the Orinoco. I
expect Hughie has often told you all about that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Joan shook her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No? Well, it was like him not to. However,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page347" id="page347"></a>[pg&nbsp;347]</span>
Allerton told me for a fact that Hughie was now
home for good; so I knew then that my plans had
worked out right after all, and that I need not
hurry back. My little girl was safe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He sighed contentedly, and patted Joan&#39;s
hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m a happy old fossil, Joey,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ve
always schemed in a clumsy way to bring this
about, and now it has happened. &#39;There&#39;s a
divinity that shapes our ends,&#39; you know. And
now, I suppose, you are mistress of this old house.
How long have you been married?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;re not,&quot; said Joan in a very small voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Married.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She held up a ringless hand in corroboration.
Jimmy Marrable inspected it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where&#39;s your engagement ring?&quot; he demanded.</p>

<p class="indent">Joan felt that there was a bad time coming&mdash;especially
for Uncle Jimmy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&mdash;we&#39;re not engaged,&quot; she faltered.
Then she continued swiftly, for there was a look
on Jimmy Marrable&#39;s brown and wrinkled face
that frightened her, and she wanted to get explanations
over: &quot;Hughie and I didn&#39;t quite care
for one another&mdash;in that way. No, I&#39;m a liar. <i>I</i>
didn&#39;t care for Hughie in that way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He asked you, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>[pg&nbsp;348]</span>
&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you&mdash;wouldn&#39;t&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Joan nodded. She suddenly felt unreasonably
mean and despicable. She had declined to marry
Hughie in all good faith, as she had a perfect
right to do, for the very sufficient reason that she
did not like him&mdash;or his way of putting things&mdash;well
enough; and she had felt no particular compunction
at the time in dealing the blow. But
none of these reasons seemed any excuse for hurting
Uncle Jimmy.</p>

<p class="indent">Since then, too, her feelings towards Hughie
himself had altered to an extent which she was
just beginning to realise. Of late she had found
herself taking a quite peculiar interest in Hughie&#39;s
movements. Why, she hardly knew. He paid
her few attentions; he was habitually uncompromising
in what he considered the execution of
his duty; and he had made a shocking mess of her
affairs. But&mdash;he was in trouble; people were
down on him; and he had been her friend ever
since she could remember.</p>

<p class="indent">Now Joan Gaymer, if she was nothing else,
was loyal; and loyalty in a woman rather thrives
on adversity than otherwise. And a woman&#39;s loyalty
to a man who is her friend, if you endeavour
to overstrain it or drive it into a corner, in nine
cases out of ten will protect itself, Proteus-like, by
turning into something entirely different, a something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349"></a>[pg&nbsp;349]</span>
which is quite impervious to outward attack
and can only be strained to breaking-point by one
person&mdash;the man himself; and not always then,
as countless undeserving husbands know. Joan&#39;s
loyalty to Hughie was in some such process of
transition. She thought about him a good deal,
but she had never once faced the question of her
ultimate relations with him. The modern maiden
is not given to candid analysis of her own feelings
towards members of the opposite sex,&mdash;she considers
these exercises &quot;Early Victorian,&quot; or &quot;sentimental,&quot;
or &quot;effeminate&quot;; and consequently
Joan had never frankly asked herself what she
really thought about Hughie Marrable. At times,
say when she heard people speak ill of her deputy-guardian
behind his back, she had been conscious
that she was hot and angry; at others, when something
occurred to bring home to her with special
force the tribulations that Hughie was enduring,
she had been conscious of a large and dim determination
to &quot;make it up to him,&quot; in some manner
as yet undefined and at some time as yet unspecified.
In short, like many a daughter of Eve
before her, she had not known her own mind. She
knew it now. Her heart smote her.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly Jimmy Marrable&#39;s voice broke in
with the rather unexpected but not altogether unreasonable
question:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then if you aren&#39;t either engaged or married
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>[pg&nbsp;350]</span>
to Hughie, may I ask what the deuce you are doing
in his house?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It isn&#39;t his house,&quot; replied Joan, recalling her
wandering attention to the rather irascible figure
by her side. &quot;He has let it to the Leroys, and he
and I are both staying here as guests just now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What on earth did the boy want to let the
place for? Why couldn&#39;t you and the Leroys
come and stay here as <i>his</i> guests?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think,&quot; said Miss Gaymer delicately, &quot;that
Hughie is&mdash;rather hard up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hard up? Stuff! He has eight hundred a
year, and enough coming in from the estate to
make it pay its own way without any expense to
him. How much more does he want?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think Hughie is a very good business
man,&quot; said Joan.</p>

<p class="indent">She made the remark in sincere defence of
Hughie, just as a mother might say, &quot;Ah, but he
always <i>had</i> a weak chest!&quot; when her offspring
comes in last in the half-mile handicap. But
Jimmy Marrable, being a man, took the suggestion
as a reproach.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nonsense!&quot; he said testily. &quot;Hughie has as
hard a head as any man I know. What do you
mean by running him down? Have you any complaint
to make of the way he has managed <i>your</i>
affairs&mdash;eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;None whatever,&quot; said Joan promptly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>[pg&nbsp;351]</span>
&quot;But&mdash;bless my soul!&quot; cried Jimmy Marrable;
&quot;I forgot! You haven&#39;t <i>got</i>&mdash;&quot; He
paused, and appeared to be working out some
abstruse problem in his head. &quot;Look here, Joey,&quot;
he continued presently, &quot;if you aren&#39;t married
to Hughie, what are you living on?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Joan stared at him in astonishment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On the money you left behind for me,&quot; she
said. &quot;What else?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The old gentleman regarded her intently for
a moment, and then said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course: I forgot. I suppose Hughie pays
it to you quarterly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes&mdash;into my bank account,&quot; replied Miss
Gaymer with a touch of pride.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How much?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it <i>quite</i> fair to tell?&quot; inquired Joan, instinctively
protecting her fraudulent trustee.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course. It was my money in the first instance.
Go on&mdash;how much?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Four hundred a year,&quot; said Joan. &quot;It was
three hundred at first. Hughie told me you hadn&#39;t
left as much as he expected, and that I should
have to be careful. But Ursula Harbord&mdash;she
is the girl I share a flat with: she is frightfully
clever about money and business&mdash;told me to
ask Hughie what interest I was getting on my
capital, or something. I found out for her&mdash;four
per cent, I think it was&mdash;and she said it wasn&#39;t
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>[pg&nbsp;352]</span>
<i>nearly</i> enough. There were things called preference
shares, or something, that pay ten or twelve
per cent; and Hughie must sell out at once, and
buy these instead. What&#39;s the matter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jimmy Marrable had suddenly choked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing! Nothing!&quot; he said, in some confusion.
&quot;A smart girl, this friend of yours!
Takes a large size in boots and gloves, I should
say, and acts as honorary treasurer to various
charitable organisations! Twelve per cent! Aha!&quot;
He slapped himself feebly. &quot;And what did
Master Hughie say to <i>that</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I could see he didn&#39;t half like it,&quot; continued
Joan; &quot;but Ursula had declared that if I wouldn&#39;t
allow her to speak to him, she would consult
some responsible person; as she was <i>sure</i> Hughie
was mismanaging things disgracefully. So to keep
her quiet I let her. I think Hughie saw there was
something in what she said, though; because he
immediately agreed to give me four hundred a
year in future instead of three. <i>Is</i> it enough, Uncle
Jimmy, or has poor Hughie really made a
mess of things, as people say? <i>Say</i> it&#39;s enough,
Uncle Jimmy! I <i>know</i> he did his best, and I&#39;d
rather go without&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Enough?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jimmy Marrable turned and scrutinised his
ward closely, as if appraising her exact value.
Certainly she was very lovely. He whistled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page353" id="page353"></a>[pg&nbsp;353]</span>
softly, and nodded his head in an enigmatical
manner.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;d have done it myself,&quot; he murmured darkly.
&quot;Enough?&quot; he repeated aloud. &quot;My little girl,
do you know how much capital an income of four
hundred a year represents?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Joan shook her head. Her experience of finance
was limited to signing a cheque in the
proper corner.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, about ten thousand pounds.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hoo!&quot; said Miss Gaymer, pleasantly fluttered.
&quot;Have I got all that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! How much, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jimmy Marrable told her.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354"></a>[pg&nbsp;354]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chXIX" id="chXIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="h3">IN WHICH LOVE FLIES OUT OF THE WINDOW</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Hughie</span> closed the door on Joan, and breathed
a gentle sigh of relief. He was spoiling for a fight,
and he had just got his hands free, so to speak.
Brief but perfect satisfaction lay before him.</p>

<p class="indent">He resumed his position in front of the fire.
Mr. Haliburton sat on an oak table and swung
his legs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, Marrable&mdash;&quot; began the latter briskly.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie interrupted him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Haliburton,&quot; he said, &quot;you heard my
intimation to Miss Gaymer just now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did,&quot; said Mr. Haliburton.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I should like to repeat it to you. The
marriage which has been arranged&mdash;by you&mdash;will
not take place. That&#39;s all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That,&quot; replied Mr. Haliburton easily, &quot;is a
matter for Joan and myself&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will refer to my ward as Miss Gaymer for
the rest of this interview,&quot; said Hughie stiffly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly. To resume. You see, Marrable,
although you were appointed Miss Gaymer&#39;s
guardian by the eccentric old gentleman who
bears the same name as yourself, your authority
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>[pg&nbsp;355]</span>
does not last for ever. I understand that the lady
will shortly become her own mistress.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In which case she will have the control of
her own property.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot;&mdash;Mr. Haliburton paused, and flicked
the ash off his cigarette,&mdash;&quot;don&#39;t you think that
this display of authority on your part, considering
that it is subject to a time-limit, is rather
ridiculous?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have only one observation to make on that
point,&quot; said Hughie coolly, &quot;and that is, that I
have made no display of authority of any kind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear sir,&quot; said Mr. Haliburton, raising his
histrionic eyebrows, &quot;aren&#39;t you forbidding the
banns?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have never forbidden anything. I have
merely stated that the match will not come off.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t let us quibble, man!&quot; said Haliburton
impatiently. He got off the table. &quot;Look here,
Marrable, there is no need for you and me to be
mealy-mouthed in this matter. Let&#39;s be frank.
You want this girl: so do I. She can&#39;t marry
both of us, so she must pick one. She has picked
me: I have her word for it. She says she cares
for me more than any man in the world, and
would tramp the roads with me. And I with her!
Why, man&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>[pg&nbsp;356]</span>
As he uttered these noble words Mr. Haliburton
struck an attitude which many young women
in the front row of the pit would have considered
highly dramatic, but which merely struck the
prejudiced and unsympathetic male before him
as theatrical in the extreme.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Drop it!&quot; said Hughie. &quot;You make me quite
sick.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He spoke the truth. He did not know whether
Haliburton&#39;s rhapsody rested on any assured
foundation or not. But in any case Joan&#39;s fresh
and innocent youth was a very sacred thing, and
even the suggestion that she could have anything
in common with this glorified super made him
feel physically unwell.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Haliburton broke off, and smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Marrable,&quot; he said, almost genially, &quot;we
understand each other! I see you want plain
English. I said just now that we were both fond
of the girl. So we are. But I fancy we are both
a bit fonder of her little bit of stuff&mdash;eh? Now,
you have been handling the dibs for a matter of
eighteen months, I understand. You have feathered
your nest pretty comfortably, from all I hear.
Don&#39;t be a dog in the manger! Let your friends
into a good thing too!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The mask was off with a vengeance. Hughie
swallowed something and thanked God that, if
his wanderings among mankind had taught him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page357" id="page357"></a>[pg&nbsp;357]</span>
nothing else, they had taught him to hold himself
in till the time came. He said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Haliburton, I have told you several times that
I do not forbid this engagement; because, as you
have very acutely pointed out, my <i>veto</i> does not
last for ever; but the match is not coming off, for
all that. Before you go I will explain what I mean.
I don&#39;t want to, because the consequences may
be serious, both for Miss Gaymer and myself;
but it will show you how absolutely determined I
am to make a clean sweep of you.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should like to say in the first place that I
should never have stood between Miss Gaymer
and <i>any</i> man, so long as I honestly thought he
could make her happy&mdash;not even a man whom
I personally would regard as an ass or an outsider.
But there are limits to everything, and
you strike me as being the limit in this case. I
have been making inquiries about you, and I now
know your antecedents fairly well. You apparently
are an actor of sorts, though all the actors
of my acquaintance look distinctly unwell when
your name is mentioned. However, whatever
you are, I should be sorry to see any woman in
whom I take an interest compelled to spend even
half an hour in your company. In fact, if you
had not originally come down here as a friend of
Lance Gaymer&#39;s,&mdash;over whom, by the way, I
find you once had some hold,&mdash;I should have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page358" id="page358"></a>[pg&nbsp;358]</span>
asked Captain Leroy&#39;s permission to kick you
out of the place some time ago!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Haliburton looked a little uncomfortable.
He held a good hand, but Hughie was obviously
not bluffing. He had an uneasy feeling that
there must be an unsuspected card out somewhere.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To come to the main point,&quot; continued
Hughie, &quot;I want this engagement to be declared
off by <i>you</i>, not by me. What is your price?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Haliburton breathed again. Bribery?
Was that all? He replied briskly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How much have you got?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is a thousand pounds any use?&quot; asked
Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Twenty might be,&quot; replied the lover.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My limit,&quot; said Hughie, who was not a man
to haggle about what Mr. Mantalini once described
as &quot;demnition coppers,&quot; &quot;is five thousand
pounds.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Talk sense!&quot; said Mr. Haliburton briefly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The offer,&quot; continued Hughie steadily, &quot;is
open for five minutes. If you accept it I will write
you a cheque now, and you will sit down and
write a letter formally breaking off, on your own
initiative, any engagement or understanding you
may have entered into with Miss Gaymer, and
undertaking never to come near her again; and
I will see she gets it. If not&mdash;well, you&#39;ll be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page359" id="page359"></a>[pg&nbsp;359]</span>
sorry, for you&#39;ll never make such a good bargain
by any other means.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Haliburton eyed him curiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is this your own money you are offering me?&quot;
he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is,&quot; said Hughie, looking at his watch.
&quot;Three minutes left.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Won&#39;t it make rather a hole in your capital
account?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will. In fact, hole won&#39;t be the word for it!
But it will be worth it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Intelligence dawned upon Mr. Haliburton.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see,&quot; he said slowly. &quot;You expect to recoup
yourself later, when&mdash;when the marriage settlements
are drawn up, eh? Or perhaps,&quot; he added
sarcastically, &quot;eighteen months of careful trusteeship
have put you in a position to afford this
extravagance!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie was surprised at his own self-control.
Only the little pulse which Joan had noticed beat
assiduously in his right temple.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fifteen seconds!&quot; he said. &quot;Do you take this
offer, Mr. Haliburton?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Right!&quot; Hughie put his watch back into his
pocket and regarded the misguided blackmailer
before him rather in the manner of a benevolent
policeman standing over a small boy with a
cigarette.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id="page360"></a>[pg&nbsp;360]</span>
&quot;Your last few remarks,&quot; he said, &quot;have been
so offensive that I know you would not have had
the pluck to make them unless you thought you
had me absolutely under your thumb. But I may
as well proceed to my final move, and terminate
this interview. I am very averse to taking this
particular step, because its results may be awkward,
as I said, for Miss Gaymer. That is why I
offered you practically all the available money I
have to call the deal off. But I see I can&#39;t help
myself. Now, Haliburton,&mdash;by the way, I forgot
to mention that your real name is Spratt: you
seem to have become a big fish since you took to
fortune-hunting,&mdash;I am going to make you break
off your engagement. I am going to pay you a
high compliment. I am going to give you a piece
of information, known only to myself and Miss
Gaymer&#39;s banker, for which you will ultimately
be very grateful, and the knowledge of which will
cause you, when you get outside (which will be
very soon now), to kick yourself for a blamed fool
because you did not accept my first offer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Haliburton-Spratt shuffled his feet a trifle
uneasily, and Hughie continued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You seem to be suffering from an aggravated
attack of the prevailing impression that Miss
Gaymer is an heiress. Her fortune has been
variously estimated by tea-table experts at anything
from forty to a hundred thousand pounds.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page361" id="page361"></a>[pg&nbsp;361]</span>
I will now tell you what it really is. Get off the
table: I want to open that dispatch-box.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Haliburton, conscious of a slight sinking
sensation just below the second button of his
waistcoat, moved as requested, and Hughie took
out of the box a bank-book and a bulky letter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When I came home from abroad,&quot; he said,
&quot;I found this letter awaiting me. It is from my
uncle. The following passage will interest you:
&#39;... I have realised practically all my personal
estate, and have placed the cash to your credit on
Joey&#39;s behalf&#39;&mdash;Joey is the name,&quot; he explained
punctiliously, &quot;by which Miss Gaymer is known
to her intimate friends&mdash;&#39;at the Law Courts
Branch of the Home Counties Bank.... The
rest of my property is set down and duly disposed
of in my will, and cannot be touched until my
death is authenticated.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope there was a respectable sum in the
bank,&quot; said Mr. Haliburton, his spirits rising
again.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie opened the pass-book.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When I went to the bank in question,&quot; he
said, &quot;and asked to be allowed to see the amount
of my balance, I was handed this pass-book.
From it you will gather the exact value of Miss
Gaymer&#39;s fortune at the moment when I took
over the management of her affairs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He handed the book to Mr. Haliburton. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>[pg&nbsp;362]</span>
devout lover glanced eagerly at the sum indicated
on the balance-line&mdash;and turned a delicate
green.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see?&quot; said Hughie calmly, taking the
book back. &quot;One hundred pounds sterling! A
poor exchange for five thousand, Mr. Haliburton!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is the money?&quot; said Haliburton
thickly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That I can&#39;t tell you. But you will see by the
book and this duly endorsed cheque,&quot;&mdash;he
picked a pink slip out of the dispatch-box,&mdash;&quot;that
the sum of thirty-nine thousand, nine hundred
pounds&mdash;the amount he had put in a few
days before, less one hundred&mdash;was drawn out
of the bank, in a lump, by my uncle himself the
day before he sailed. Why he did it, I can&#39;t imagine.
He must have changed his plans suddenly.
All I know is that he has put me in a very tight
place as a trustee, and you in a much tighter one
as a suitor, Mr. Haliburton!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He took the cheque from the hands of the demoralized
Haliburton, and closed the dispatch-box.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a long silence. At length Hughie
said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I presume I may take it that you now desire
to withdraw from this engagement?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You may!&quot; said Mr. Haliburton emphatically.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page363" id="page363"></a>[pg&nbsp;363]</span>
He was too deeply chagrined to play his
part any longer.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie surveyed him critically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re a direct rascal, Spratt,&quot; he said; &quot;you
are no more hypocritical than you need be. But
you&#39;re a rascal for all that. Well, I won&#39;t keep
you. Good afternoon!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Mr. Haliburton&#39;s quick-moving brain had
been taking in the altered situation, with its
strong and weak points so far as he himself was
concerned. He had not lived by his wits twenty
years for nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose,&quot; he observed, reseating himself on
the corner of the writing-table, &quot;it would be
indiscreet to inquire from what source the young
lady, with a capital of one hundred pounds sterling,
is at present deriving an income of apparently
three or four hundred a year?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not only indiscreet, but positively unhealthy,&quot;
said Hughie, turning a dusky red. His fingers
were curling and uncurling.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Haliburton directed upon him what can
only be described as a depredatory eye.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you think, Mr. Marrable,&quot; he said,
&quot;that it would be a good thing to&mdash;<i>square</i> me? I
could do with that five thousand. This is a censorious
world, you know; and scandalous little
yarns are apt to get about when a young lady
accepts&mdash;<i>Hrrrumph!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page364" id="page364"></a>[pg&nbsp;364]</span>
It was the last straw. Hughie&#39;s iron restraint
snapped at last. Both his and Mr. Haliburton&#39;s
impressions of the next few moments were distinctly
blurred, but at the end of that period
Hughie, breathing heavily and feeling as if he
had just won a valuable prize in a consolation
race, found himself facing Jimmy Marrable, who
had entered the door just as Love (as represented
by Mr. Haliburton) flew out of the window.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo, Hughie!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo, Uncle Jimmy! Half a mo&#39;!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Haliburton, seated dizzily in a rose-bed in
the garden, heard Hughie&#39;s step returning to the
French window above his head. A walking-stick
suddenly speared itself in the soil beside him, and
a pair of gloves and a Homburg hat pattered
delicately down upon his upturned countenance;
while Hughie&#39;s voice intimated that there was a
swift and well-cushioned train back to town at
six-twenty.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, closing the window and leaving Mr. Haliburton
to extract himself tenderly from his bed
of roses, cursing feebly the while and ruminating
bitterly upon the unreliability of proverbial expressions,
Hughie turned to the room again. It had
just occurred to him that in the heat of the moment
he had been a trifle cavalier in his reception
of a relative whom he had not seen for ten years,
and who he imagined had been dead for four.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id="page365"></a>[pg&nbsp;365]</span>
Half an hour later Jimmy Marrable enquired:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would it be too much to ask whom you were
throwing out of the window when I came in?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Friend of Joey&#39;s,&quot; said Hughie briefly. &quot;And
now, Uncle Jimmy,&quot; he added, with clouding
brow,&mdash;the joy of battle was overpast, and the
horizon was dark with the wings of all kinds of
chickens coming home to roost,&mdash;&quot;I should like
to inform you that you and your financial methods
have put me in a devil of a hole. I want an explanation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Right. Fire away!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, when I took on the job bequeathed to
me by you of administering Joan&#39;s affairs, I discovered
that instead of being an heiress, the child
was practically penniless. For some idiotic reason
best known to yourself, you no sooner put money
into the bank for her than you dragged it all out
again. Consequently I discovered that I was
booked to manage the affairs of a girl whom
everybody thought to be the possessor of pots of
money, but whose entire capital&quot;&mdash;he picked
up the pass-book&mdash;&quot;amounted in reality to one
hundred pounds sterling.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Correct!&quot; said Jimmy Marrable. &quot;Proceed!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If,&quot; continued Hughie in an even and businesslike
tone, &quot;Joan had been prepared to marry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page366" id="page366"></a>[pg&nbsp;366]</span>
me, the money wouldn&#39;t have mattered, as she
could have had mine. Unfortunately that event
did not occur.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did she know she hadn&#39;t any money when
you asked her to marry you?&quot; enquired Jimmy
Marrable.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And did she go on refusing you after you had
informed her she was a pauper?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie had seen this question coming from
afar. He turned a delicate carmine. His uncle
surveyed him, and nodded comprehendingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite so!&quot; he said. &quot;Quite so! You never
told her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Hughie, &quot;I hadn&#39;t the heart. It
seemed like&mdash;like trying to coerce her into marrying
me. No, I just let her imagine that she had
a tidy little fortune invested, and that she could
live on the interest&mdash;three hundred a year. I&mdash;I
found that sum for her, and she took it all right.
After all, she was a woman, and women will
swallow almost anything you tell them about
money matters. If they jib at all, all you have
to do is to surround yourself with a cloud of
technicalities, and they cave in at once. I think
Joey was a <i>little</i> surprised at not getting more,
for she had thought herself a bit of an heiress;
but she never said a word. In fact, she was so
kind about it that I saw she was convinced I had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id="page367"></a>[pg&nbsp;367]</span>
made a mess of things somewhere, and must be
protected accordingly. She put it all down to
my usual incompetence, I suppose,&mdash;as far as
I can see, she considers me a born fool,&mdash;and
accepted the situation loyally.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She would do that,&quot; said Jimmy Marrable.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; continued Hughie, &quot;Joan was all
right, but everybody else was the devil. An awful
girl friend of hers, called Harbord&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know&mdash;twelve per cent!&quot; gurgled Jimmy
Marrable.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Well, she came and gave me beans to
begin with. Then young Lance began to suspect
me,&mdash;he never could stand me at any price,&mdash;and
he came and raised Cain one day at a luncheon
party I was giving&mdash;but, by the way, that&#39;s
all right now; Lance has come round completely.
Even the Leroys couldn&#39;t conceal their conviction
that I had made a bungle somewhere&mdash;an
honest bungle, of course, but a bungle. And finally
an unutterable sweep called Haliburton came
along. I knew something of him&mdash;so much, in
fact, that it never occurred to me that there was
anything to fear from him. But he got the master-grip
on me when every one else had failed. Joey&mdash;our
Joey&mdash;fell in love with him and promised
to marry him!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have heard nothing of this. What sort of
fellow is he?&quot; enquired Jimmy Marrable.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>[pg&nbsp;368]</span>
&quot;Much the same type, I should say, as the late
lamented Gaymer, senior.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you sure&mdash;about her falling in love?&quot;
continued Jimmy Marrable, in a puzzled voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Looks like it,&quot; said Hughie. &quot;I was away
yesterday, and got back early this morning. I
found a note from Joey on my dressing-table,
saying that Haliburton had proposed to her, and
that she was sending him along to me to ask for
my consent. She wouldn&#39;t have gone as far as
that if she didn&#39;t&mdash;if she didn&#39;t&quot;&mdash;His voice
shook. &quot;It was a pill for me, Uncle Jimmy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did you do?&quot; said Jimmy Marrable.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did this. I knew quite well that if Joey&mdash;loved
him&quot;&mdash;the words came from between his
clenched teeth&mdash;&quot;she would stick to him, blackguard
or not. She&#39;s that sort.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is. Well?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I came to the conclusion that if there was to
be a rupture of the engagement it must come
from him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You made him break it off?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How? By throwing him out of the window?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. That would have been no good if he was
really after her money. I simply told him the
truth&mdash;the whole truth&mdash;about her bank balance,
and so on. That did it. He backed out all
right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id="page369"></a>[pg&nbsp;369]</span>
Jimmy Marrable rubbed his hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And then ideas began to occur to him&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Exactly. He began to ask questions&mdash;to
make innuendoes&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. I then threw him out of the window.
It was some consolation. That is the story.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie turned away, and gazed dejectedly
into the fender. Presently Jimmy Marrable
remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And meanwhile the fat is in the fire?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is,&quot; said Hughie bitterly. &quot;Uncle Jimmy,
what <i>will</i> she think? Everything is bound to
come out now,&mdash;that fellow will run about telling
everybody,&mdash;and when she hears of the
cruel position I&#39;ve placed her in she&#39;ll never speak
to me again. We shan&#39;t even be ordinary good
friends now. Poor little girl! I&#39;ve done her
the worst turn a man can do a woman; and I
would have <i>died</i> for her&mdash;cheerfully!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie leaned against the tall mantelpiece
and dropped his head upon his arms. &quot;Joey!
Joey!&quot; he murmured to himself, very softly.</p>

<p class="indent">Jimmy Marrable retired to a remote corner
of the room, where he spent some time selecting
a cigar from Jack Leroy&#39;s private locker. Presently
he returned. Observing that his nephew
was apparently not quite ready to resume the
conversation, he spent some time in lighting the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page370" id="page370"></a>[pg&nbsp;370]</span>
cigar, bridging over the silence with a rumbling
soliloquy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a blessing to be back on dry land again,&quot;
he observed, &quot;where cigars will keep in decent
condition. No more green weeds for me! What
I like is a good crisp Havana that splits open
if you squeeze the end, instead of&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie once more stood erect on the hearthrug.
The fit had passed.</p>

<p class="indent">Jimmy Marrable eyed him curiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hughie, boy,&quot; he said, &quot;it was a mad, mad
scheme. Why did you do it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie turned upon him, and blazed out
suddenly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; he cried. &quot;Because there was nothing
else to do! Do you think I would let our Joey&mdash;no,
damn it! <i>my</i> Joey&mdash;go out as a governess or
a chorus-girl&mdash;yes, she actually suggested <i>that</i>!&mdash;when
I could keep her happy and comfortable
by telling one little white lie? It may have been
a mad thing to do; but it was a choice of evils,
and I&#39;d do it again! So stuff that up your cigar
and smoke it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Silly young owl!&quot; remarked Jimmy Marrable.
He lit his cigar with fastidious care, and
continued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose you want an explanation from <i>me</i>
now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page371" id="page371"></a>[pg&nbsp;371]</span>
&quot;Well, the withdrawal of that money was an
eleventh-hour notion. It suddenly occurred to
me that you, with your imbecile ideas about
honour and filthy lucre, and so forth, might feel
squeamish about making love to a girl with a
fat bank balance. So just before I sailed I drew
the money out, imagining that by so doing I
should be removing the only obstacle to a happy
union between you and Joey. The entire affair
was intended to be a walk-over for you. Between
us, we seem to have made a bonny mess of things.
Hughie, we Marrables are not cut out for feminine
fancywork.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is to be done now?&quot; said Hughie
gloomily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have thought of that,&quot; said Jimmy Marrable.
&quot;When a man gets in a hopeless tangle of
any kind, his best plan is to ask a woman to help
him out. That is what we shall have to do. Wait
here a few minutes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He turned towards the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mildred Leroy won&#39;t be in for half an hour
yet,&quot; called Hughie after him, &quot;so it&#39;s no good
looking for her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right!&quot; replied Jimmy Marrable&#39;s voice
far up the stairs.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372"></a>[pg&nbsp;372]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chXX" id="chXX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="h3">SINFUL WASTE OF A PENNY STAMP</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Ten</span> minutes passed. Hughie, leaning heavily
against the frame of the French window, gazed
listlessly out at a squirrel which was inviting him
to a game of hide-and-seek from the far side of a
tree-trunk.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One thing,&quot; he mused,&mdash;&quot;I shall be able to
go abroad again now. No more of this&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was the faintest perceptible rustle behind
him. Joan must have come in very quietly,
for the door was shut and she was sitting on the
corner of the writing-table,&mdash;exactly where the
recently-departed Haliburton had been posing,&mdash;swinging
her feet and surveying her late guardian&#39;s
back. In her hand she held a pink slip of
paper.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie never forgot the picture that she presented
at that moment. She was dressed in white&mdash;something
workmanlike and unencumbering&mdash;with
a silver filigree belt around her waist. She
wore a battered Panama hat&mdash;the sort of headgear
affected by &quot;coons&quot; of the music-hall persuasion&mdash;with
a wisp of pale blue silk twisted
round it. The evening sun, streaming through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page373" id="page373"></a>[pg&nbsp;373]</span>
most westerly of the windows, glinted on her hair,
her belt, and the silver buckles on her shoes.
Hughie caught his breath.</p>

<p class="indent">Joan spoke first.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here&#39;s something for you, Hughie,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie took the proffered slip of paper. It was
a cheque, made out to himself and signed by
Jimmy Marrable.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think that covers all the expense to which
you have been put on my account while Uncle
Jimmy has been away,&quot; said Joan. Her voice
sounded gruff and businesslike.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie examined the cheque. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said,
&quot;it does.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was very good of you,&quot; said Joan formally,
&quot;to advance me so much money. I had no idea
you were doing it. Apparently you might never
have got it back again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie gazed at her curiously. He began to
grasp the situation. He was to be whitewashed:
the compromising past was to be decently buried,
and &quot;Temporary Loan&quot; was to be its epitaph.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind that,&quot; he said awkwardly. &quot;All
in the day&#39;s work, you know! Afraid I was a rotten
trustee.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly Joan&#39;s demeanour changed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And now, my man,&quot; she said briskly, &quot;will
you be good enough to explain what you mean by
compromising a lady in this way?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page374" id="page374"></a>[pg&nbsp;374]</span>
Hughie looked at her for a moment in dismay.
Then he saw that her eyes were twinkling, and he
heaved a sudden sigh of incredulous relief. He
was forgiven!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Joey!&quot; he said,&mdash;&quot;Joey, you mean to say
you&#39;re not angry?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Furious!&quot; replied Miss Gaymer, smiling in
her old friendly fashion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank God!&quot; said Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Gaymer changed the subject, rather hurriedly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s something else I want to ask you,&quot;
she said. &quot;Will you kindly inform me what has
become of my&mdash;ahem!&mdash;young man?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who?&quot; said Hughie. &quot;Oh, <i>that</i> chap? He is
gone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gone? Where?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;London, I should think.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In the first place, because I told him about
your&mdash;I mean&mdash;I wouldn&#39;t advise you to ask
me, Joey. You see&mdash;I should hate&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You would hate,&quot; said Miss Gaymer, coming
to his rescue, &quot;to say &#39;I told you so!&#39; I
know, Hughie. It&#39;s like you, and I love you
for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie winced. These colloquial terms of endearment
are sometimes rather tantalising. Still,
he must not mind that. The girl, too, had had her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page375" id="page375"></a>[pg&nbsp;375]</span>
disappointment, and was bearing herself bravely.
At least&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Joey,&quot; he said suddenly, &quot;did you <i>really</i> care
for that bloke?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The lady on the table stiffened suddenly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&mdash;that poisonous bounder?&quot; She
rolled up her eyes. &quot;My che-ild!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you let him make love to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Did</i> I? I suppose you were there,&quot; observed
Miss Gaymer witheringly, &quot;disguised as a Chinese
lantern!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, what <i>did</i> you do, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He asked me to be his blushing bride,&quot; said
the unfeeling Miss Gaymer, &quot;and tried to grab
my hand. I squinted down my nose, and looked
very prim and sweet, and thought we had better
be getting back to the ballroom, and he could
talk to Mr. Marrable in the morning. If that&#39;s
your idea of allowing people to make <i>love</i>, dear
friend&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you&mdash;you&mdash;promised to marry him!&quot;
said poor Hughie.</p>

<p class="indent">Joan stared at him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you mean to tell me, Hughie,&quot; she said
slowly, &quot;that he told you <i>that</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes&mdash;with one or two corroborative details.
That was why I had to tell him&mdash;everything, you
know. It was the only way, I thought, to choke
him off.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page376" id="page376"></a>[pg&nbsp;376]</span>
&quot;O&mdash;o&mdash;oh!&quot; Miss Gaymer wriggled indignantly.
&quot;The creature! And when he heard I
had no money, he cried off?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie bowed his head. Joan gave a low
gurgling laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s no getting over it, Hughie!&quot; she said.
&quot;He scored. A nasty slap for little me! But I
deserved it, for trying to trifle with his young
affections. Well, you have given me one reason
for his departure. What was the other?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie eyed her in some embarrassment.
Then he said,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He began to talk about you, Joey, in a way
I didn&#39;t like, so I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His eye slid round towards the window, and
then downward in the direction of his right foot.
A smile crept over his troubled face, and he
glanced at Joan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Hughie, <i>did</i> you?&quot; she exclaimed rapturously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. He landed in that rose-bed. Look!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Joey shuffled off the table and joined him by
the window. A few feet below them, on the rose-bed,
lay the unmistakable traces of the impact
of a body falling from rest with an acceleration
due to something more than the force of gravity.</p>

<p class="indent">Joan cooed softly, evidently well pleased.
Hughie turned and regarded her with a puzzled
expression. No man ever yet fathomed the workings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page377" id="page377"></a>[pg&nbsp;377]</span>
of the feminine mind, but he never quite
gives up trying to do so.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you glad that he got thrown out?&quot; he
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">Joan pondered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s not exactly that,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m not
glad he was thrown out: it must have hurt him,
poor dear! But I&#39;m glad you threw him out, if
you understand the difference.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie was not at all sure that he did, but he
nodded his head in a comprehending manner.
Then he continued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me, Joey, if you didn&#39;t care for him,
why did you send him to me, instead of giving
him the knock direct?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Joey surveyed her retired &quot;warder&quot; with eyes
half-closed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; she said reflectively, &quot;there were heaps
of reasons, but you are a man and wouldn&#39;t understand
any of them. But, roughly speaking, it
was because I wanted to see how you would handle
him. I knew you wouldn&#39;t let him marry me,
of course, but I wanted to see how you would
play your cards. (You simply don&#39;t <i>know</i> how
fascinating these things are to watch.) Besides, I
thought it would be good for him to come face to
face with&mdash;a <i>man</i>,&quot; she added, almost below
her breath.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I only got the best of him,&quot; said Hughie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378"></a>[pg&nbsp;378]</span>
humbly, &quot;by laying all my cards on the table.
There&#39;s not much <i>finesse</i> required for a game
like that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Still, you won,&quot; said Joan.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie sighed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Haliburton lost, if you like,&quot; he said; &quot;I don&#39;t
quite see what <i>I</i>&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No&mdash;you <i>won</i>!&quot; said a very small but very
insistent voice by his side.</p>

<p class="indent">Hughie turned sharply. Miss Gaymer was
breathing expansively upon the glass of the window,
and assiduously scribbling a pattern thereon
with her finger&mdash;an infantile and unladylike
habit of which her nurse thought she had cured
her at the age of eight. Also, her cheeks were
aglow, and that with a richness of colouring which
sufficed to convey some glimmerings of intelligence
even into the brain of the obtuse young man
beside her. Hughie suddenly felt something inside
his head begin to buzz. His gigantic right hand
(which still contained Jimmy Marrable&#39;s cheque
tucked in between two fingers) closed cautiously
but comprehensively upon Joan&#39;s left, which
was resting on the window-frame, much as a
youthful entomologist&#39;s net descends upon an
unwary butterfly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Joey,&quot; he said unsteadily,&mdash;&quot;Joey, what do
you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Gaymer sighed, in the resigned but persevering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page379" id="page379"></a>[pg&nbsp;379]</span>
fashion of a patient Sunday-school
teacher. Then she slipped her hand from under
Hughie&#39;s, extracting as she did so the folded
cheque from between his fingers. Hughie watched
her dumbly.</p>

<p class="indent">Joan unfolded the cheque, and perused it in
a valedictory sort of manner. Then she kissed it
softly. Then she tore it up very slowly into small
pieces.</p>

<p class="indent">She sighed again pensively, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There goes my ransom! It&#39;s a wicked waste&mdash;of
a cheque-stamp! Now,&quot; she added cheerfully,
&quot;I am compromised worse than ever.
Hughie, dear, I <i>really</i> think, after this, that
you&#39;ll have to&mdash;Ough! Hughie! <i>Hughie!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For blind, groping Hughie&#39;s eyes were open
at last. With an exultant whole-hearted roar he
initiated a sudden enveloping movement; and
then, turning away from the fierce light that
beats upon actions performed at a window,
strode majestically (if rather top-heavily) towards
a great leather sofa in a secluded corner beyond
the fireplace. The scandalised Miss Gaymer,
owing to circumstances over which she had no
control, accompanied him.</p>
